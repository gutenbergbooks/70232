</p>


<p>The city of Boston, as may be known to many of my readers, is only
approachable by water and a long narrow isthmus, called “the neck.”
For this reason it is said to be “the head of New England;” but the
people in the country, who are extremely jealous of the prerogatives of
“the townsfolks,” merely call it “the great metropolis.” When it was
first settled, which is more than two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> hundred years ago,—for which
reason it is termed “an ancient and honourable city,” and the families
descended from those settlers “ancient and honourable families,”—it
contained, somewhere in the neighbourhood of what is now called
“Beacon-street,” three large promising bumps, which however, entirely
disappeared as the baby grew older, and are now smoothed down almost to
a flat.</p>

<p>The neck forms a large well-paved causeway, lined chiefly with wooden
houses, (in the principal streets the buildings are of stone or brick,)
and connects the city with the borough of Roxbury, which contains
alone above ten thousand inhabitants. Coming from New York, this is
the regular entrance to the town; and through it therefore I arrived,
driving straight up to the Tremont House. This is a large, massive
building with a granite front and a brick back, situated in the most
eligible part of the city, and considered as the crack house of the
place.</p>

<p>I found the interior very comfortable, and could have procured a
parlour and chamber for the modicum of thirty-six dollars (about seven
guineas) a week, if an acquaintance of mine, whom I accidentally met
at the bar, had not advised me to content myself with a bedchamber,
and dine at the ordinary; which, he said, would reduce my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> expenses to
about one-third, without diminishing very materially my respectability.
“Our <em>first</em> people,” said he, “are satisfied with similar
accommodations: they little care how and where they sleep, provided
they live in a fashionable quarter; and prefer dining at an ordinary,
because at a public table they get more to eat for less money. We are
<em>republicans</em>,” added he, “especially in this city, which is
called the <em>cradle</em> of liberty.”</p>

<p>Not knowing whether he meant this as a satire, I proposed to
take a walk with him before dinner, in order that I might have a
<i lang="it">cicerone</i> to direct my first impressions of so classical a
place; and accordingly we sallied forth, taking the direction down
Tremont-street towards the Common.</p>

<p>“You see here at once the finest place in the whole city,” said my
cicerone; “one which might be enjoyed by all classes, if we had not
already outgrown the <em>cradle</em>. The people who live in these
houses, and who, with very few exceptions, have all been to England, do
not like to be seen in public. They hate the arrogance of our grocers
and mechanics, who would be apt to stare them out of countenance if
they were to show themselves at a public walk. ‘Humility,’ they say,
‘is not the besetting sin of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> people: on the contrary,
the lower classes think themselves just as good as we are; and, what
is worse, they <em>know</em> that they are our political masters.’ This,
they argue, is absolute madness, as a man may learn by a single trip
to Europe. ‘There <em>must</em> be a heaven’s aristocracy of talent and
knowledge, ‘as one of our great men<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> used to say,’ and consequently
also a h—ll’s democracy of ignorance and prejudice. The latter must
not be encouraged in any way, and, least of all, by suffering ourselves
to be confounded with it in private or public.’</p>

<p>“It was with the greatest difficulty,” continued he, “that our
aristocratic inhabitants of Beacon and Park streets<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> could be
prevailed upon to suffer benches to be placed in the Mall. They had two
reasons for opposing this popular measure: first, because it encouraged
idleness, inducing people who ought to be at work or at home to come
here and bask themselves in the sun; and, secondly, because it was
possible from those benches either to see the people at the windows of
the houses, which would be inconvenient,—or from the windows of those
houses to see the people on the benches, which, as the sight of poverty
and idleness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> does not particularly enhance the beauty of a landscape,
would be ‘shocking.’ Malicious persons say that there are yet other
reasons for opposing the benches; but I could never bring myself to
believe them.”</p>

<p>As we were ascending the little eminence on which stands the
State-house, we were met by a lawyer, who, learning that I was a
stranger come on purpose to see the capital of New England,—the
<em>ideal</em> capital, namely, because New England is divided into six
States, each of which has its own metropolis,—accompanied us, in order
probably to become acquainted with my opinions, and in the evening
report them to his friends.</p>

<p>For the information of my readers I must observe, that the Boston
State-house is a heavy, clumsy piece of architecture, the style and
arrangement of which are neither striking nor convenient. I was told
that the building was originally intended to be erected on a much
larger scale; but that, from motives of republican economy, its wings
were afterwards clipped to their present dimensions,—the main body,
for which there were sufficient funds on hand, remaining full as large
as in the first design. The whole is crowned by a wooden cupola,
of such enormous height as not even to leave the possibility of an
illusion of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> being made of stone, as in this case the walls would
not be strong enough to support it. These are confessions which, in
Boston, would not only render me unpopular, but actually expose me to
being mobbed; but, at a distance of two hundred miles, (I write this
in the city of New York,) one does feel less afraid of expressing
one’s opinions and sentiments. The interior of the house contains a
statue of Washington, by Chantrey; a broad staircase; a large hall of
representatives; and a number of smaller rooms for committees, and the
several offices of the departments of state.</p>

<p>“This house,” said the lawyer, after heaving a deep sigh, “once
the receptacle of a <em>noble</em> body of men, is now open to every
gingerbread man from the country; or you would see it built in a
different style, worthy of the legislative assembly hall of a powerful
republic, like that of Massachusetts! But the fact is, instead of
great men, our house of representatives is now composed of members
who advocate ‘mackerel inspection,’ cider-presses, fences, raising
potatoes, and brewing small beer. Having no general ticket, each town
or village must send its quota of advocates of its own particular
industry; who, moreover, come here for no other purpose than to oppose
the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> elevated measures proposed by the more enlightened members
for Boston.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact,” observed my cicerone; “our city representatives wish
them all to ‘<em>where they don’t rake up fire o’ nights</em>.’ They have
so far degraded their station, that it is now a disgrace, and not an
honour, to be delegated by the people.”</p>

<p>“And what have they done to disgrace themselves?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“That is soon told,” replied the lawyer; “every country member comes
here with the determined purpose of opposing <em>us</em>, and, above all
things, to let the Bostonians contribute largely to the expenses of the
State. We pay nearly one-third of all the taxes; and yet we call this
<em>a republican government</em>!”</p>

<p>“One of equal justice, you ought to have said,” interrupted the
cicerone.</p>

<p>“As if justice could co-exist with universal suffrage!” ejaculated the
lawyer.</p>

<p>“I would pardon all,” resumed the cicerone, with a sarcastic smile,
“if our country members were to spend the money, which we pay them for
lounging about town, in a liberal and gentlemanly manner: but, instead
of that, they select the worst boarding-houses, from which they expel
our journeymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> mechanics, in order to live cheap; and, instead of wine
and other liquors, which our merchants and grocers could make a profit
of, consume immense quantities of that dreadful stuff which, under the
name of ‘New England cider,’ is sometimes placed on our tables, and for
which even our <em>sharpest</em> landlords dare not make a charge.”</p>

<p>“The positive fact is,” exclaimed the lawyer, “that few of our
representatives are gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“And that very few gentlemen will now-a-days consent to become
representatives,” added my cicerone, “except it be for Congress; and
even that will not last long, if things go on much longer in the way
they have for the last seven or eight years.”</p>

<p>As the disposition of the higher classes of Bostonians to ridicule the
institutions of their country were known to me, I paid no particular
attention to their remarks, which were made as we were gazing on the
statue “<em>of the hero of the revolution</em>.” I only remember that
the lawyer went on in a strain of uninterrupted eloquence, abusing the
trial by jury, the vote by ballot, and, <i lang="la">à fortiori</i>, universal
suffrage. “We just wanted that,” he said, “to complete our misery! As
if our mob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> had not enough power without it! Our democracy is of the
worst kind; it does not strive for equality, but for supremacy. It
becomes at once our jury, judge, legislator, and governor. You dare not
act as you please in your own house; you dare not educate your children
in your own way; you dare not express a wish of your own but what you
have to dread to be exposed in public, and have your name paraded in
the newspapers. Every man in this city is a spy on his neighbour, a
voluntary, unpaid police-agent of the rabble, that pries into all your
actions and motives, and is always ready to attribute them to the worst
source. And yet we talk of personal liberty, as if such a thing could
exist in a republic!”</p>

<p>“But is the description you give of your townsmen not applicable to all
classes?” demanded I; “is it only the labouring classes, or ‘the mob,’
as you call them, which act as spies to the community?”</p>

<p>“We are all naturally a curious, inquisitive people,” replied he; “and
a cunning one too, because we hardly ever answer one question except by
asking another; but all these faults are increased by the tendencies of
our institutions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Have you been less curious or inquisitive before the revolution?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly that; but the inquisitiveness of the lower classes was
less troublesome. Our gentlemen were not obliged to notice it; they
were not directly responsible to the people; in short, <em>we</em> were
in every respect more independent than we now are.”</p>

<p>I thought it best not to continue this sort of conversation; so,
quitting the house, and walking down Beacon-street, I pointed to a new
building which struck me as remarkably tasteful. “Here,” said I, “is
quite a stylish mansion! I did not expect to find so much neatness and
comfort in this city!”</p>

<p>“It is the mansion of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***,” replied my cicerone. “Don’t you think
it a fine building? And in the Italian style, too! The owner is one of
our richest men,—the son of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, who came to Boston in the year
——. He made all his money in the —— business, and must now be worth
upwards of a million of dollars. He has a very nice family too. His
wife was a Miss ***, daughter to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, one of our most respectable
merchants; quite an <em>intellectual</em> girl, with plenty of money. I
believe she brought him three hundred thousand dollars. Her sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
married a <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, one of the most <em>influential men</em> in this city.
They have been a good deal abroad, and furnished their house in the
best style——”</p>

<p>Fearing that I should be condemned to listen to a long description of
the various articles of furniture brought home from London or Paris,
and at last to the statistics of the gentleman’s property,—a thing
which is by no means unfrequent in Boston,—I abruptly changed the
conversation by directing my cicerone’s attention to an unfinished
building, whose enormous height was entirely disproportionate to the
small surface it covered on the ground.</p>

<p>“This house,” I said, “seems to be perfectly new; how did it happen
that so eligible a site for building remained so long a time
unimproved?”</p>

<p>“It was a fine garden,” replied my cicerone, “belonging to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***,
living in the house adjoining it; but he sold it as a house-lot for the
neat little sum of twelve thousand dollars. It’s only a small piece of
ground, just large enough for two parlours on a floor; but our houses
are all three or four stories high, none of us wishing to be overlooked
by his neighbour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Did he keep the ground on speculation?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Bless your soul, sir!” exclaimed he; “do you think <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** is a
speculator? He is a rich man, sir! he does not care for the money;
‘it’s only for the conven’ance of it,’ as the New Hampshire farmer
said, when he dunned the gentleman for a bushel of potatoes. Who the
deuce would not take twelve thousand dollars for a little garden,
scarcely large enough to raise cabbage for the family?”</p>

<p>“Especially in a town where no man possesses anything he would not
sell, provided a proper price be offered him,” added the lawyer.</p>

<p>While we were thus talking, we had reached the mill-dam which leads
over to Brooklyne, and from which we enjoyed a truly magnificent view
of the panorama of Boston. I observed to my companions that their city
was one of the finest in the Union; and that, as far as I might be
allowed to judge, it could be made a most delightful residence.</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> a delightful place,” replied the lawyer; “but our old
families are gradually losing their influence. Most of the fine houses
you see here are inhabited by <i lang="fr">roturiers</i>; our society is getting
worse and worse every day; and, while we expend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> thousands for our
public schools, we lose our manners.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact,” exclaimed my cicerone; “our young men are not half
so polite as the old ones; and, what is worse, the influence of family
is entirely lost. Our young ladies, for instance, do not value birth
and good breeding half so much as money. They would rather marry a
woodcutter, if he had shown himself ‘clever’ in making money, than the
son of our oldest gentleman.”</p>

<p>“But pray, gentlemen,” interrupted I, half impatiently, “why cannot
you enjoy the many blessings Heaven has bestowed on you, without being
continually afraid of losing your dignity? I have heard more talk
about aristocracy and family in the United States than during my whole
previous life in Europe. You embitter your enjoyments and pleasures
by endeavouring to exclude from them all that come after you; and,
in doing so, wound the feelings of many an honest man, who, but for
a little more urbanity on your part, would be your friend instead
of your enemy. A question of interest which is now agitating the
country<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> may for a moment unite you; but the union is an unnatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
one, and on that account cannot last. Your state of society is such,
that, in the ordinary intercourse with your fellow-citizens, you must
necessarily offend more than you can gratify; and the mortifications
which two-thirds of the whole population are constantly suffering from
the small portion distinguished from the rest by nothing but success
in business, must add to the natural jealousies felt by the labouring
classes of all countries with regard to the rich. The distinction
between the different orders of society may be more <em>apparent</em>
in England,—as they are, from historical reasons, with all people of
Saxon origin; but they are, nevertheless, far less offensive than yours.</p>

<p>“In all countries in which there exists an hereditary, wealthy
nobility, there exists a sort of good-will towards the inferior classes
which leads to the relation of patron and client, and through which
many an apparent injustice is smoothed over by liberality and kindness;
but the mere moneyed aristocracy which is establishing itself in
this country, however you may disguise the fact by cunning and soft
speeches, or an hyperbolical affectation of republicanism, <em>hates</em>
the industrious masses over whom it strives to elevate itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“The exclusiveness of your wealthy brokers, that hoard money without
<em>spending</em> it, offends the people without benefiting the artisan
or the tradesman; and the meanness with which your first people bargain
for every trifle to save a penny, renders their custom scarcely
desirable to respectable tradespeople. You are extravagantly fond of
splendour, and yet are afraid of displaying it. You must understand me
right: I speak of the rich, calculating Bostonians, who really live on
their property; not of your wealthy men in New York, who live on nine
months’ credit. Besides, you yourself will allow that your aristocracy
is far from being generally well educated, and I do not see how this
fault is to be remedied as long as wealth constitutes the chief title
to good society.</p>

<p>“Your aristocracy, therefore, has not the power of dazzling the lower
classes with that air of self-possession and dignity by which gentlemen
of rank are at once recognised in Europe. On the contrary, the
manners of your rich people in their intercourse with less successful
aspirants to fortune are markedly coarse and vulgar, in order, I
believe, to give the latter to understand that they are sufficiently
<em>independent</em>—that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> I think, is the word,—not to <em>care</em>
for their opinion.”</p>

<p>Here the lawyer pleaded a pressing engagement; and left us, without
shaking of hands, or expressing a desire of seeing me again.</p>

<p>“You have made an enemy of that man,” observed my cicerone, “who will
make you a hundred more enemies if you should ever think of settling in
this city.”</p>

<p>“He did not seem to be offended,” replied I; “or I should have checked
my tongue before he left us.”</p>

<p>“You can never tell when these people are offended,” he rejoined; “but
you may rely upon one thing,—they will never forgive you. They lock
their wrath up, until a favourable opportunity presents itself for
taking summary vengeance. If I were in your place, <em>I would make
myself scarce</em>.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I mean, I would not show myself too much in public, or in society; or
perhaps engage my passage to New York.”</p>

<p>“And you call this a free country!” exclaimed I, “and the manners of
your people those of high-minded gentlemen! Good manners in other
countries consist in putting every one at ease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> which may be done
without being in the least degree familiar; but here the higher classes
seem to be determined upon making every one that is poorer than
themselves feel his inferiority, in order to make him as uncomfortable
as possible. And all this is done with an affectation of republican
simplicity, which makes every species of arrogance only the more
offensive as coming from an equal. The Southern people, whom you
pronounce much more aristocratic, and who perhaps are so in the English
sense of the word, are infinitely more amiable in their manners, merely
because <em>their</em> exclusiveness relates to family and education, and
because they are not continually in contact with the labouring classes.</p>

<p>“In order to make any kind of aristocracy tolerable, it is necessary
that it should, in some shape or other, either protect the lower
classes, or never come in contact with them. The aristocracy of the
Atlantic cities is unfortunately neither a protector of the lower
orders, with whom it is continually wrestling for power; nor is it,
from its political position and mode of life, capable of avoiding
incessant contact with them. Hence arises a continual jarring: the rich
claiming a rank which the poor are unwilling to grant; and the poor
provoked by the <em>unprofitable</em> arrogance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> of the rich, opposing
to them a species of insolence which a labouring man in Europe would
hardly dare to offer his equals.</p>

<p>“I recollect some time ago having travelled on board of a canal-boat
from Harrisburg to Pittsburg. The accommodations on board of these
boats, the most bigoted American—and I know I address myself to
none such—could not but call miserable; and yet, the majority being
satisfied, none dared to murmur. Our meals were shocking; cooked in the
worst manner, and served as no man in England would place a piece of
bread before a day labourer. During the night we were put on shelves,
of which three were placed one above the other at a distance of not
more than from sixteen to twenty inches, and so close together that
the feet of one person touched the head of his neighbour, and <i lang="la">vice
versâ</i>. To complete our misery, the cabin was not ventilated, the
door being kept closed in order to prevent those who lay next to it
from taking cold; and we slept without sheets, the same unwashed and
uncleaned blankets having perhaps served in turn to a hundred different
pedlars and emigrants. But the <i lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> was one of the
captains,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a New-Englander by birth; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> puny, pale, consumptive
fellow with sharp grey eyes, thin pointed nose, long deeply-indented
chin, and a dash across his face marking the opening of the mouth
in the absence of lips. His voice, something between a growl and a
grunt, seemed to proceed from a subterraneous cavern; while his hands,
carefully concealed in his pockets, indicated, by their position, the
usual current of his thoughts.</p>

<p>“This fellow, whom no man of correct judgment would have made keeper
of a pack of hounds, used to look upon the whole company with an air
of conscious superiority; strutting the deck as if he were commander
of a frigate, and scarcely deigning to address a word to any of
the passengers. You will excuse me for this digression, which you
will readily forgive when you reflect that I but agree with you in
the opinion that, much as the New-Englanders are to be esteemed at
home,—and there is none more ready to pay homage to their public and
private virtue than myself,—they are nevertheless among the dullest,
driest, and most disagreeable adventurers one meets abroad. This man
had the impudence to serve the same meat three times to his passengers:
first, with tea and coffee in the morning; then, with pure water at
noon; and lastly, though there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> was scarcely enough left to feed a
dog, the remainder of the dinner was once more brought upon the table
in the shape of a supper. Previous to that, we had been <em>kept</em>,
as they call it, by a fat round-faced German, who gave us at least
<em>plenty</em> to eat, and a friendly face in the bargain; but our
Yankee captain seemed to be determined to make the most of our cash,
without contracting the irregular polygon of his face into anything
approaching a smile.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, a German gentleman, who, to judge from
his merry voice, and two large bumps of alimentiveness gracing his
circular forehead, was fond of humour and good cheer, was amusing the
company in tolerable good English with a few unequivocal innuendoes
in reference to their <em>English comforts</em>; which were no sooner
uttered than the captain, probably thinking that the <em>foreigner</em>
was an <em>aristocrat</em> not admiring the institutions of the country,
told him that his conversation was ‘most perfectly disgusting,’ and
that, if he did not ‘hold his tongue,’ he should be obliged to put him
ashore. These, as far as I can recollect, were the very words of the
ill-humoured blackguard; and such an effect did they produce on the
company that none dared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> demonstrate against his insulting conduct,
though they <em>whispered</em> to one another that it was not altogether
<em>gentlemanly</em> or <em>just</em>.</p>

<p>“Now, this man would not have been half so insolent if the gentleman
whom he reprobated had not been decently dressed, so as to lead him
to suppose that he wanted to play the aristocrat. It was a species of
revenge against what he imagined to be the taunts and sneers of ‘a
vulgar upstart,’ who, in spite of his money, resorted to this mode of
travelling for the sake of saving expenses.</p>

<p>“If the higher classes claim superior respect, it is but just they
should pay for it, as the higher classes do in Europe, where a man is
charged according to his rank; but how few of your fashionable people
are willing to lay out an additional groat for the distinction they so
ardently covet. They want to be esteemed merely because they are rich,
though their wealth does not benefit any of their fellow-citizens.”</p>

<p>“I remember a young Bostonian,” observed my cicerone, “who employed a
second-rate barber to cut his hair. The task not being performed to
his satisfaction, he indignantly rose from the chair, placed a piece
of twelve and a half cents (the usual price being twenty-five) on the
table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> and, opening the door with great fury, told the affrighted
little Frenchman that he should never <em>patronise</em> him again.</p>

<p>“Such instances of the liberality of our first people,” he continued,
“occur every day; as you may yourself witness by frequenting our
market. Every one of our gentlemen purchases his own provisions, so
as to render the collusion of the servants with the tradespeople,
which you know exists to a lamentable extent in England, wholly
impossible. Our aristocracy, I can assure you, are a shrewd people; but
unfortunately for the comforts of domestic life, their servants are
equally shrewd, and stay with their calculating masters no longer than
they can <em>help</em> it.</p>

<p>“This state of things,” added he, after a pause, “does not exist at
the South. There the veriest fault of the people is generosity. The
slaves, who enable them to be aristocratic without being mean, stand
to them in the relation of vassals to their lords; and the planters,
not fearing the power and political influence of their slaves, but, on
the contrary, having an interest in their physical well-being, treat
them generally with humanity and kindness. There never was a great
moral evil, without producing also some good; and thus it is that the
very relation between master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> and slave engenders ties and affections
which no one can understand without having witnessed their effect. I
have seen the wives of planters watch at the sick-bed of their slaves,
and perform acts of charity which the misconstrued self-esteem of our
Northern people would have deemed menial, merely because the feelings
of <em>kindness</em> and <em>gratitude</em>, which are strongest in the
Southern States, are, with us, construed into <em>obligation</em> and
<em>payment</em>; two things which effectually destroy all poetry of
life, even in the relation of parents to their children. I am not here
disposed to underrate the miseries of slavery, as they will always
appear to the mind of an European; but I cannot entirely overlook
some of the advantages which result from it to the moral and social
relations of the country.”</p>

<p>And I could not but agree with my cicerone. If the tendency of wealth
in the Northern States is towards an aristocracy of money, the
aristocracy of the Southern States, founded on birth and education,
is a sort of offset to it,—a means of preventing the degeneration of
the high-minded democracy which once swayed the country, into a vulgar
oligarchy of calculating machines without poetry, without arts, and
without generosity.</p>

<p>“After all, the greatest benefactors of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> people were
Southerners, from the great father of the country, down to its last
chivalrous defender. Southern orators are yet the most eloquent;
Southern statesmen the most disinterested in their views of national
politics. Genius requires a heart as well as a head, or the seed lacks
the warmth necessary for its germination. Give me the man whose blood
flows quickly through his veins, with his ready perception and his
high sense of honour! If aristocracy, the original sin of society,
must be entailed upon man in every climate, then let me at once have
that of the South. Give me an aristocracy above the cares and toils of
ordinary life, which has the means and the leisure to devote itself to
higher pursuits than mere pecuniary gain and profit,—an aristocracy
to whom national honour and glory are not words without meaning, and
whose estimation of a people’s happiness is not deduced merely from its
statistics of commerce and manufactures!</p>

<p>“I have always hoped, and still hope, that the democratic principle
will, in America, prevail over all the others: but if this hope should
prove delusive; if, in the phraseology of one of the ablest senators in
the United States, ‘the multiplied wants of the country’ should beget
an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> universal worship of Mammon as the means of satisfying them; then I
would rather live surrounded by negroes, and, in the society of their
aristocratic but high-minded and generous masters, seek some feeble
consolation in the reflection that Rome and Greece were likewise cursed
with slavery. I would prefer the aristocracy of the Southern States
to that of the North, for precisely the same reason that I prefer,
generally, a nobleman to a <i lang="fr">roturier</i>.”</p>

<p>“You are not very singular in your notions,” observed my cicerone. “I
do not remember a single European that came here but what expressed
the same opinion; but this singular coincidence has not in the least
changed the opinion of our people, who are perfectly satisfied that
their city stands unrivalled in the world for virtue, wisdom, and
patriotism.”</p>

</p>


<p>The day after my arrival in Boston I delivered my letters of
introduction. Some I merely sent with my card; others I carried in
person, according to the custom of the country. My reception could not,
of course, be equal to that of a well-recommended Englishman; the word
“de” having, by my request, been suppressed in all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> letters, and it
not being known at that time that I was about to commit my impressions
to paper. Yet was I received with politeness; subject, however, to a
sort of cross-examination, of which, for the benefit of travellers, I
will here furnish a short extract.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“How do you like this country?”</p>

<p><i>Answer</i> (of course).—“Extremely well.” (It will do no harm to
show a little enthusiasm; the Bostonians, having little of that article
themselves, like to see it in others.)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“How does this country appear to you compared with
England?”</p>

<p>(This is a question never asked by the labouring class, who seem to
care little or nothing about it; and proves at once your being in good
society. You must answer it with great circumspection; as, if you give
America the preference, they either think you a hypocrite, or a person
not used to society and the world; and, if you show yourself too great
a partisan for England, their vanity will never forgive you.)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“Do you intend to settle here?”</p>

<p>(This question is best answered in the negative.)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“Are you married or single.”</p>

<p>(If the stranger be a man of moderate fortune,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> it will be best for him
to call himself a married man; the fashionable society of Boston having
a great dread of poor bachelors.)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“Do you not think we <em>enjoy</em> a very bad climate?”</p>

<p>(This they really believe; but it is prudent in Europeans stoutly
to deny it. The fact is, it is really not half so bad as generally
represented; there being more sunny days in America than, perhaps with
the exception of Italy or Spain, in any part of Europe.)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—“Don’t you think the transition from heat to cold
very sudden?”</p>

<p>(Deny it by all means, even if there should have been a change of
twenty degrees that very day.)</p>

<p>Then comes the praise of the American “falls,” in which any one may
join conscientiously; an American landscape in the month of October
being, on account of the infinite variety in the colour of the woods,
and the extreme serenity of the sky, the most beautiful thing in the
world.</p>

<p>National vanity—a feeling which is totally distinct from
patriotism—exists in no part of the United States to such an extent
as in New England, and especially in Boston, whose inhabitants think
themselves not only vastly superior to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> people in Europe, but also
infinitely more enlightened, especially as regards politics, than the
rest of their countrymen. Thus the question has been seriously proposed
to me, whether I had not been struck with the superior intelligence of
the Bostonians, compared with the inhabitants of other cities in the
United States and in Europe? and whether, on the whole, I had found any
people in the world superior to those of New England?</p>

<p>These faults apart, I found the Bostonians quite an
<em>entertaining</em>, I could not conscientiously say an
<em>hospitable</em> people, because one does not feel at home amongst
them, even after a residence of many years. The fact is, that though
they boast of an unusual degree of “common sense” in their common
transactions of life, very little of it is seen in their society.
Society is the only sea with the navigation of which the New-Englanders
are as yet unacquainted, in spite of the English, French, and Italian
charts they study for that purpose. The moment their ladies and
gentlemen sit in state, they are affected and awkward; <i lang="fr">et quand le
bon ton parait, le bon sens se retire</i>.</p>

<p>What the wealthy Bostonians generally understand by common sense, and
the influence which the latter exercises on society, I soon had an
opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> of learning, at the house of a fashionable gentleman, a
president of a bank, with whom I had the pleasure of dining a few days
after my arrival in the city.</p>

<p>The individual in question was between forty-five and fifty years of
age; apparently of a high bilious temper, with a livid complexion, grey
piercing eyes, straight hair, compressed lips, thin nose and chin,—in
short, a figure which in any part of the world I should have at once
recognised as belonging to a matter-of-fact man from New England. There
were but two more gentlemen to dine with us, and no ladies besides the
wife and daughters of our entertainer; so that conversation soon began
to flag, until, the dessert being put on the table, the restraint was
taken off from the gentlemen by the good-natured retiring of the ladies.</p>

<p>Mine host was the first person who broke in upon the monotony of the
entertainment, by introducing a topic which at once commanded the
attention of his friends.</p>

<p>“Common sense,” he said, after having drunk the first glass of madeira
and passed the bottle, “is the <em>genius</em>, or, as I do not like
that word, the <em>essence</em> of society and good government; and I
think,” added he with a self-complacent smile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> “no people in the world
have inherited a larger share of this most invaluable commodity than
our <em>cool, calm, calculating, money-making</em> Yankees. Did you”
(addressing himself to me) “ever see a more intelligent people than our
Bostonians? Did you ever see a city more quiet, more prosperous, more
orderly than Boston?”</p>

<p>“The appearance of Boston,” responded I, “certainly warrants all you
say of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he rejoined; “and I can point out to you at least one
hundred persons in that city worth upwards of a hundred thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“That certainly argues in favour of the industry and perseverance of
its inhabitants.”</p>

<p>“Say rather it argues in favour of their <em>common</em> sense,” said he,
“in which industry and perseverance are necessarily included. We are a
common sense, matter-of-fact people,” added he exultingly; “we leave
genius and enthusiasm to Europeans.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed his neighbour on the left, “I have no genius
in <em>my</em> family; my children are all brought up to be industrious.”</p>

<p>“You may thank the Lord for that,” replied our entertainer; “I
never saw a genius yet who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> was either himself happy or capable of
making others so. I have brought up my sons to become merchants and
manufacturers; only Sam, the poor boy who is a little hard of hearing,
and rather slow of comprehension, shall go to college. Our merchants,
sir, are the most respectable part of the community.”</p>

<p>“What college do you mean to send him to?” demanded I, in order to
ascertain whether he had been serious.</p>

<p>“I shall send him to Harvard University,” he replied; “the oldest
literary institution in the country. Have you not yet been to see it?”</p>

<p>I told him that I had been but a few days in Boston, but that I should
certainly take an early opportunity of visiting the institution.</p>

<p>“Do so,” he said; “you will find it well worth your while; it will
convince you that, while we have been making money, we have not
altogether neglected arts and sciences.”</p>

<p>“Which are your cleverest men in the various departments of science?”
demanded I.</p>

<p>“Why, they are none of them very clever in <em>our</em> sense of the
word. We consider professors as secondary men. Our practice is to give
the different professorships away to young men, in order to induce them
to devote themselves to the branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> they are to teach. Our country is
as yet too young for old professors; and, besides, they are too poorly
paid to induce first-rate men to devote themselves to the business of
lecturing.”</p>

<p>“In this manner,” rejoined I, “you will never have eminent men in the
higher departments of philosophy.”</p>

<p>“We have as yet no time to devote to abstract learning,” he observed;
“we are too young for that. Our principal acquirement consists in
common sense; all the rest we consider as moonshine. You must know,” he
said, with a countenance in which superiority of knowledge was mingled
with condescension of manners, “that a young man learns as much in six
months in a counting-room as in four years at college. My friends do
not entirely agree with me; but I often told them that our colleges
only made poor gentlemen, and spoiled clever tradesmen.”</p>

<p>He then counted over the names of most of the rich men in Boston, who,
he said, were all self-taught country boys, possessed of no other
learning than the art of making dollars in a neat, handsome, clean
manner. “This,” he added, “has given them a higher standing in society
than they could have acquired by all the philosophy in the world, and
enabled them to marry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> into the oldest and most aristocratic families
of the place.</p>

<p>“Take, for instance, the case of our friend ***. What does he know
except making money? What has he ever learned except negociating, or
rather <em>shaving</em> notes? What college did he ever go to, except
that of our brokers in State-street? And has he not married the
daughter of one of our richest men? Has he not got one of the largest
fortunes with her? And is he not now connected with some of our first
people—with the real back-bone of our Boston aristocracy? And do you
know the answer his father-in-law gave to one of his old friends, who
remonstrated with him for giving his daughter away to a <i lang="fr">parvenu</i>
from the country? ‘I give my daughter to any man,’ said he, ‘who will
come to Boston and have wit enough to make a hundred thousand dollars
in six years.’ There’s common sense for you, I trust: that’s what we
call practical philosophy.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly a melancholy fact,” sighed the gentleman next to me,
who now for the first time opened his lips, “that a great number of our
young men, who have gone to college, have afterwards been unsuccessful
in business. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> think our education is not sufficiently practical;—we
are still attached to the European system.”</p>

<p>“Not only that,” replied our entertainer, “but most of our students
contract habits of idleness, which will never answer in this country.
They want to imitate your English gentleman, when their patrimony—I
mean their <em>share</em> in their father’s fortune—is scarcely
sufficient to keep them alive. Do you remember <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***’s reply to a
young gentleman who had asked him his advice as to what he ought to do
in order to succeed in business? ‘Take off your kid gloves,’ said he,
‘and go to work.’ There’s philosophy for you, equal to your Kants and
Leibnitz! <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, you know, is a plain-spoken man, who came to Boston
without a cent in his pocket, and is now one of our most respectable
citizens.”</p>

<p>“But if this be the prevailing taste of your townsmen,” said I, “why do
you call Boston the Athens of the United States?”</p>

<p>“That appellation,” replied he, “refers to our women, not to our
gentlemen. Our ladies read a great deal. And why should they not? What
else have they to do? And we have, besides, a lot of literary twaddles,
manufactured by the wholesale at Cambridge, who attempt to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> the
heads of our young girls with the nonsense they call ‘poetry,’ which
fills nearly all our papers, instead of clever editorials. If we have
one poet among us, we have at least fifty, the joint earnings of whom
would not be sufficient to keep a dog. But then poets don’t turn
<em>our</em> heads, you see; we are too much occupied with business.”</p>

<p>“But how do your literary men manage to get on?” demanded I: “I know
several of them quite in easy circumstances.”</p>

<p>“They marry rich women, who can afford paying for being entertained.
They show their common sense in that. It’s quite the fashion for our
rich girls to <em>buy themselves a professor</em>, previous to taking a
trip to Europe.”</p>

<p>“And then,” added my neighbour on the right, “literary reputations are
in this city not acquired, as in other places, through the medium of
public opinion; but by the aid of a small coterie, composed of a few
‘leading citizens,’ who have the power of setting a man up, or putting
him down, just as they please;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the process being this. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> A. or
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> B., wealthy gentlemen in Beacon-street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> declare <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Smith a fine
scholar; and immediately half a dozen of their clique will repeat the
same assertion. The individual in question is thus made fashionable,
so that any one speaking against him is considered unacquainted with
the usages of society. Those, therefore, whose opinion—if they dare
to have one—is different from <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> A.’s and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> B.’s, are most likely
to keep it to themselves; while every person aspiring to rank and
fashion publicly swears to his scholarship: for our people, you must
know, are accustomed to do everything from fear; nothing from love. If
you want to succeed in anything,—if you want to carry any particular
measure,—enlist half a dozen influential citizens in your behalf, and
the rest will not dare <em>to back out</em>. That’s the way things are
done in this city.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is,” he continued, “that our coteries are small,
and, for the most part, led by one or two <em>prominent members of
society</em>, who, on all similar occasions, act as dictators. Add to
this, that our fashionable men have not the advantages of education and
leisure enjoyed by the higher classes in Europe, and that their manners
are generally stiff, uncouth, and overbearing; and you will easily
understand why our society, so far from resembling that of Athens,
must necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> counteract the independent developement of mind and
character.</p>

<p>“This habit of conforming to each other’s opinion, and the penalty set
upon every transgression of that kind, are sufficient to prevent a
man from wearing a coat cut in a different fashion, or a shirt-collar
no longer <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>, or, in fact, to do, say, or appear
anything which could render him unpopular among a certain set. In
no other place, I believe, is there such a stress laid upon ‘saving
appearances.’ I once asked a relation of mine for what sum of money he
might be prevailed upon to suffer his mustachoes to grow? He demanded
twenty-four hours ‘to figure it out,’ and then told me the next day
that he could not do it for one cent less than ten thousand dollars.
He reasoned thus: ‘I am a man of moderate property, the interest of my
patrimony being barely sufficient to pay for my board, I am therefore
obliged to work, in part, for my living; but, my wants being few, an
additional six hundred dollars would cover all my expenses. These I
hope to earn by practising law, to which profession I was bred, and,
for which I feel a natural predilection. Now, if I wear mustachoes, I
must resign my practice as a lawyer; for with mustachoes I can neither
go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> to court, nor obtain a respectable chamber practice. Six hundred
dollars are the interest, at six per cent. per annum, of ten thousand
dollars, which, therefore, would be sufficient to make up for my loss;
for I can manage to live without society.”</p>

<p>“A few singularities of that sort may be charged to every people,”
observed the gentleman of the house; “and, besides, I really do not see
what business a young man has to wear mustachoes: I would certainly not
employ him in a counting-room. We are a young people; and, as such,
must endeavour to get on by hard work, not by dandyism. Some of our
instructors have the good sense to inculcate this doctrine even into
our children; and I do not see why grown persons should be permitted to
set up a different rule for themselves.”</p>

<p>“And pray, sir,” demanded I, “in what manner do your instructors teach
children the necessity of working?”</p>

<p>“In the best manner,” replied he, “common sense could dictate.
<em>They make them study for money.</em> They distribute annually a
certain sum,—say, from eighty to a hundred dollars,—in the shape of
prize-money, among those who obtain the highest marks at the different
recitations, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> which the pupils are numbered as high as <em>plus</em>
seven, and as low as <em>minus</em> seven; a certain number of positive
marks entitling the child to one cent prize-money. At the end of the
school-term accounts are made out, when each child receives a check
on a bookseller or stationer for the amount due to him; for which he
may now select a book, a pen-knife, or some other trifling article,
according to his own pleasure; on which, moreover, the instructor
himself enjoys a liberal discount.”</p>

<p>“But does not this practice,” I said, “introduce sordid habits at an
age in which the mind is most susceptible of receiving impressions, and
in which it is of the greatest importance to instil into children more
elevated notions of honour and justice?”</p>

<p>“You are entirely mistaken,” replied he; “and one can at once see from
your remarks that you are a little dyed in the speculative philosophy
of your country. No stimulus to learning can be half as great as when
a boy can figure it out on his slate how many dollars and cents his
geography, grammar, spelling, reading, and good conduct come to <i lang="la">per
annum</i>.”</p>

<p>This <em>common sense</em> of the Bostonians, thought I, as I was walking
home, is, after all, very narrowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> circumscribed; referring in most
cases merely to immediate wants, and the means of satisfying them.
But it is in referring actions to ultimate principles that men rise
above common-place, in proportion, perhaps, as they render themselves
liable to error. Common sense is a sort of instinct sufficient to
guide men through the lower spheres of life; but of itself incapable
of raising them to a high moral elevation. Common sense, in fact, is
the genius of mediocrity. It does not expand or liberalize the mind, or
communicate to it any great and generous impulse. It refers to a sort
of <i lang="fr">intérêt bien entendu</i>; and is, on that account, not in very
high repute among a large portion of the Southern people. I remember
what a Southern Jacksonian once told me with regard to the politics
of Massachusetts. “We do not want that State,” he said, “to come over
to our side, because it would prejudice the rest of the Union. People
would immediately ask what concession has Government made to the
particular <em>interests</em> of that State?” This is the idea which
the Americans themselves entertain of the common sense of the leading
citizens of Boston.—<i lang="fr">Point d’argent, point de Suisses!</i></p>

<p>In the evening I saw again my cicerone, who proposed going to the
concert, which he promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> me would be one of the most fashionable
ones of the season. We accordingly shaped our course towards Masonic
Hall,—a building in style slightly approaching the Gothic, but in size
not much larger than an ordinary dwelling-house,—which, ever since
freemasonry became unpopular in Boston, has been changed into a temple
of the Muses.</p>

<p>On looking over the bill, I found that the performers had a peculiar
way of recommending themselves to the notice of the higher classes of
Americans. In the first place, all of them were professors, members
of different philharmonic societies in Europe, whose favourite airs,
duettos, concerts, &amp;c. had met with universal applause in London,
Paris, and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg. Then they were all composers; the bill
expressly announcing a favourite air from “La Gazza Ladra,” arranged by
Professor ***; duetto from “Gli Italiani in Algieri,” with variations
by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, Professor of the Royal Conservatory of ***; &amp;c. A Spaniard
even went so far as to give notice that a grand rondo, originally
composed for the violin by Mayseder, would be performed with variations
by Professor ***, late first flute-player to his Majesty the ex-Emperor
of Brazil.</p>

<p>I communicated to my friend my astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> at the fashionable people
of America being so easily duped by high-sounding titles, which in
Europe would at once stamp a man as a charlatan or a village performer;
but was assured that this was the regular way of proceeding in all the
Atlantic cities, the judgment of the higher classes in matters of taste
confirming, without a single exception, the verdict pronounced by the
connoisseurs of Europe.</p>

<p>“You will,” he said, “to-night hear the voice of a woman who in England
would at best be considered a tolerable good ballad-singer for a
provincial theatre, but you will witness the storm of applause with
which she will be received <em>here</em>. It is such a fine opportunity
for all who have taste, to show their superiority over those who
have not had an opportunity of improving themselves in Europe. This
songstress, moreover, is introduced to some of our first people,
who will collect here to-night, and by their significant nods and
half-subdued ‘bravos’ induce the multitude to the clapping of hands.
Our <em>leading citizens</em> think themselves bound by hospitality to
applaud an English <i>cantatrice</i>: for which reason the second,
third, and fourth rows of benches are occupied by <i lang="fr">tout ce qu’il
y a de mieux</i>,—that is by <i lang="fr">tout ce qui a de cent à cinq cents
mille écus</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> the first benches being declined by all, either from
modesty, or from fear of making themselves too conspicuous before the
public.</p>

<p>“An American aristocrat, you must know,” continued my cicerone, “is a
gentleman of very nice feelings, who, while he is most anxious to avoid
notoriety among <em>the people</em>, in order to avoid public censure, is
at the same time particularly solicitous to push himself forward in his
coterie, in order by his social standing to make up for the injustice
of politics.”</p>

<p>“I presume,” said I, “most of the gentlemen on the forward benches are
merchants?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” he said, standing on tiptoe. “They are mostly merchants;
but I also discover two lawyers, and a fashionable clergyman. There is,
however, not a man amongst them worth less than one hundred thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Pray, is a rich man here supposed to understand something about
music?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly he is,” replied he. “You will always find the richest
men give the first sign of approbation, after which the minor fortunes
venture to signalize theirs. Our society is so small that every man
in it is known; so that no individual can be guilty of a breach of
etiquette without having at once the whole clique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> against him. There
is more social tyranny in this place than you could find anywhere in
Europe. Every principle of morals, politics, or religion is set up as
an article of faith; our infallible moneyed men proclaiming in their
counting-rooms, and on ’change, the Popish doctrine <i lang="la">Nulla salus
extra ecclesiam Catholicam</i>.”</p>

<p>While we were thus discussing <i lang="fr">la haute société</i> of Boston,
Mrs. ***, from London, made her appearance, and—her morality being
endorsed by three responsible merchants—was received with thundering
applause; the <em>Honourable</em> <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** giving, as drum-major, the
signal with a beautiful cane, which was immediately answered by
“<em>the middling interests</em>” in the centre, and at last echoed by
the mechanics, perched up in the rear. Mrs. *** courtesied. Renewed
applause; during which she, at last, opened her cherub lips, and, with
a great deal of common sense,—that is, without any of the coquetry
of a French actress, or the <i>agaceries</i> of an Italian <i lang="it">prima
donna</i>,—sang off two or three verses of one of those English
ballads which sound so prettily in a private parlour, and so badly in
a large concert-room. The worst of it was, that instead of the simple
melody, which in most English or German compositions is exceedingly
touching, she endeavoured to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> her school, and the scope of her
voice, by introducing variations, which were duly acknowledged by the
people to whom she had been recommended. The <em>ladies</em>, especially,
seemed not so much to admire her voice, as her modesty in not looking
once from the music on the fashionable young men whose eyes were
fastened upon her.</p>

<p>English women, being fine and tall, charm sufficiently by their placid
beauty, and a certain <i lang="fr">laisser aller</i> which they carry off
admirably. French and Italian women, on the contrary, are, as a race,
far less handsome, but considerably more <i lang="fr">piquantes</i>. <i lang="fr">Ces sont
des femmes caressantes.</i> An English woman is made to be wooed; a
French one entices <em>you</em> by a thousand little trifles, which it
is the study of her life to practise with success. One is, perhaps,
truly amiable; the other <em>interests</em> you by her very peevishness.
The fair songstress seemed to be amiable in the English fashion,
for she was all good nature—the usual concomitant of a certain
<i>embonpoint</i> and smiled continually—on her music-book.</p>

<p>“But how is it possible,” said I to my cicerone, “to applaud such
singing as this? There is neither simplicity nor taste, neither feeling
nor execution in her performance, and yet the storm of applause is not
abating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“For the Lord’s sake!” exclaimed he, “do not say that loud enough for
other people to hear you. It would deprive you of many an innocent
pleasure you would perhaps otherwise enjoy during your stay in this
city. Our <i lang="fr">élite</i> never forgive such a difference of opinion to
one of their own clique; how much more, then, must a foreigner be on
his guard! And in this case, too, where <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> and Mrs. *** have taken the
songstress under their protection! It would be sufficient to exclude
you at once from society. This is <em>free</em> country, sir! every man
may do or think what he pleases, only he must not let other people know
it. You might just as well attack one of our fashionable preachers as
Mrs. ***.”</p>

<p>“If this is what you call freedom in Boston,” said I, “I will not go to
another concert, if Paganini himself were to perform here.”</p>

<p>“And yet, if you heard an oratorio performed by our ‘Handel and Haydn
Society’, you would, perhaps, change your opinion. That society is
almost wholly composed of mechanics, who cultivate music from taste,
and pay their German leader, a good scientific musician, a very
handsome salary.”</p>

<p>“Singular city this!” exclaimed I, “in which the labouring classes
cultivate music from taste,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> and in which the rich people listen to it
from obligation. I shall be obliged to leave the room. Will you not
accompany me?”</p>

<p>“I should like to do so,” whispered he; “but it would be observed.
I am obliged to live with these people; and you know the proverb,
‘Among Romans do as Romans do.’ <i lang="la">A propos</i>; if any one should ask
you about the concert, and especially about Mrs. ***, say you were
‘<em>delighted</em>;’ that’s the word now. There is no use in making
yourself enemies; <em>delighted</em>, sir! Don’t forget your cue.”</p>

<p>What an extraordinary phenomenon, thought I as I went home, this state
of society must be to an European! And is it a wonder if, under such
circumstances, the most paltry scribbler thinks himself justified in
caricaturing it? Here is a free people voluntarily reducing itself to
a state of the most odious social bondage, for no other object but to
maintain an imaginary superiority over those classes in whom, according
to the constitution of their country, all real power is vested; and
here are the labouring classes, probably for the first time permitted
to legislate for themselves, worshipping wealth in its most hideous
colours! Here, then, is a society formed as nearly as possible on the
abstract theory of equality; and this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> the state to which it has
become reduced by the aspirings of a few wealthy families in less
than a century! If such is the tendency towards decay in all human
institutions, how jealous ought the people to be of the most trifling
privileges, arrogated exclusively by certain classes.</p>

<p>And what species of tyranny is worse than that which attempts
to control a man’s private actions, his worship, his domestic
arrangements, and his pleasures? What can be more absurd than for a
certain class, for the most part not a whit better educated than the
rest, to assume the dictatorship in all matters relating to politics,
religion, or the arts? And how can it be reconciled with the spirit
of independence, manifested more or less by every American, to see so
large a portion of their countrymen governed by the tinsel logic of
such a coterie? Nothing can excite the contempt of an educated European
more than the continual fears and apprehensions in which even the “most
enlightened citizens” of the United States seem to live with regard to
their next neighbours, lest their actions, principles, opinions, and
beliefs should be condemned by their fellow creatures!</p>

<p>I have heard it seriously asserted in America, that there are no better
policemen than the ordinary run of Bostonians; and that, as long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
their natural inquisitiveness remained, there was no need of a secret
tribunal; every citizen taking upon himself the several offices of
spy, juryman, justice, and—<i>vide</i> Lynch law—executioner. This
is by some called the wholesome restraint of public opinion: but, in
order that public opinion may be just, it must not be biased by the
particular faith of a coterie; and there are transactions in private
life of which the public ought never to be made the judge.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a degree of political freedom which can compensate
a man for the loss of independence in his private transactions, and
the want of a generous liberality in the community at large. There are
individuals whose tastes and dispositions are not likely to involve
them in any political or religious controversy, and who therefore can
be comparatively free, even under a despotic government; but, in a
community like Boston, no abstract rule of conduct can be laid down,
capable of protecting a man against censure and retaliation. This
peculiarity in the composition of its society I do not, however, like
so many others, ascribe to the political institutions of the country,
which, on the contrary, are constantly counteracting its effects;
but to the aristocracy of money, unmitigated as it is by superior
education, and unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> in its influence either by the existence of a
real nobility or a powerful sovereign.</p>

<p>The <em>moveable</em>, <em>moneyed</em> aristocracy of our times I consider
as the greatest enemy of mankind, in comparison to which all the
terrors of the feudal system are as nothing. The nobility of the middle
ages offered to the people protection for vassalage, and set them
the example of chivalry and valour. A mere moneyed aristocracy, on
the contrary, enslaves the people without giving them an equivalent,
introducing everywhere the most sordid principles of selfishness,
to the exclusion of every noble and disinterested sentiment. A mere
moneyed preponderance of one class of citizens over the other, does not
form an historical link between the present and the past; neither does
it, like the masses, represent the interests of mankind in general. All
its tendencies are downwards, reducing a people gradually to a degree
of moral degradation, from which perhaps they might have been saved by
the presence of a powerful nobility of family.</p>

<p>“When I again saw my cicerone, I communicated to him my surprise at
seeing so few women frequenting theatres, concerts, and other places of
amusement. To one lady seen at the theatre there are at least three or
four gentlemen; whereas at church the relation is the reverse, proving
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> ladies to be much more piously inclined than the men.</p>

<p>“Our women,” he said, “are too much confined at home, attending on
their children; and yet this, and going to church, constitute their
only pleasures in this world. Ours is yet a country in which preachers
are better paid than actors and musicians; and a seat in a pew of
one of our fashionable ‘meeting-houses’ is offered you with the same
ceremonious politeness, as, in Italy, a box at the opera.”</p>

<p>“I have always heard that American women made the best mothers,” said I.</p>

<p>“As regards the maternal affections of our women,” replied he, “I can
easily conceive why they should be strong. It is nearly all the romance
(!) they enjoy; the duties they assume in marrying overbalancing
infinitely the caresses and attentions bestowed upon them by their
husbands. Our young men are an industrious, steady, persevering, but
not an amiable race of beings. They have a high respect for ladies in
general; but they are not devoted to them beyond the forms and usages
of society. Money-making is the principal pursuit to which they are
devoted; and which so completely absorbs their time, that, between
business and politics, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> hardly find time for the cultivation of
affections.</p>

<p>“And our rich people,” he continued, “are, in this respect, more to
be pitied than the poor. The latter spend their few leisure hours, or
rather <em>minutes</em>, at home, in the circle of their families; while
the former are compelled to waste them in society. And what society
is that? It does not consist of a few friends whom accident assembles
round the fireside, to pass away an evening in agreeable chit-chat.
Our fashionable people are not fond of this cheap, unostentatious sort
of amusement; and, besides, it does not suit the taste of our boys and
girls, who are only satisfied with a dance. For this reason our parties
are expensive, and afford little or no relaxation to men of sense. I
once heard a diplomatist say, that a young man, in order to form his
manners and judgment, ought to choose his female society from among
ladies not under thirty, and his male companions from gentlemen not
under forty years of age; but certainly, if manners and judgment are to
be acquired only on such terms, our state of society is such that our
young men must for ever remain deficient in them.</p>

<p>“If our married women were to be compensated for the loss they sustain
in society by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> increased attention from their husbands, they might
perhaps profit by the exchange. But our business men have no time for
cooing. Their first object is trade; everything else is surbordinate.
There is a great deal of domestic comfort in the United States,
resulting from sound principles of morality and religion, especially
on the part of the women; but I have hardly ever seen that tender
affection—that union of souls, in which two persons require nothing
but each other’s consent for the completion of their happiness. That
state, I am aware, requires either absolute poverty, or a degree of
wealth and refinement which, from the vain attempt to satisfy the heart
with the gratification of artificial wants, returns once more to the
legitimate source of all human happiness. Both cases are as yet unknown
in America; labour securing a competency to every industrious man, and
the laws and institutions of the country preventing the accumulation of
property.</p>

<p>“These circumstances make us a practical and active, but not an
enthusiastic or imaginative people. We choose our fair companions
according to the dictates of good sense, not after ‘some fanciful
creation of the mind.’ Our country is not yet a land of <i lang="fr">beaux
idéals</i>.”</p>

<p>“On this account,” proceeded my travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> cicerone, “we are not
subject to disappointment when the dreams of our youth are not
realized; and the organization of society prevents us even from
perceiving our error. Suppose one of our young men to marry a woman
whose tastes, disposition, and character are essentially different
from his own: it would not necessarily follow that the union must, on
this account, prove an unhappy one. The points of contact are so few,
the sphere of action of each party so well defined by custom and law,
and the occupation of the man out of the house so constant, that he
may become the father of a large family, and even die without finding
out his mistake. This assertion seems to be absurd, and yet it is
true to the very letter. And it is this sort of passiveness in all
matters not relating to business or politics, which, though it may not
constitute the most amiable or interesting feature of our character,
is nevertheless the principal cause of the universal content which
pervades our community.</p>

<p>“A similar match in Europe would be the source of endless misery.
The comparative leisure enjoyed even by the labouring classes would
prove a source of pain to two minds not perfectly tuned in unison.
Nothing creates so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> many artificial wants,—nothing is, in itself, such
exquisite luxury as leisure.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Our rich, industrious population may
pity the poor <i>lazzarone</i>, who is badly fed, scarcely covered, and
who has no other couch to lay his limbs upon but the marble steps of a
palace or a church; and yet how many such vagabonds would be willing to
exchange their position with that of our most opulent citizens? Such is
the difference in men’s ideas of happiness.</p>

<p>“An European computes his <em>time</em>, or rather his <em>leisure
moments</em>, better than his money; in America the case is reversed.
In Europe, wealth is comparatively within the reach of few; but every
one has his little share of leisure, from the day-labourer who has
his hour at noon and his vesper, to the <i>rentier</i> who lives
in idleness. Under these circumstances, the choice of a companion
determines a man’s happiness for life. Great and many are the calls
on each other’s sympathy in pleasure and in affliction, and a single
discord destroys the harmony for ever. A man may live with a woman of
different tastes,—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> may eat and drink with her,—he may see her at
specified hours of the day,—he may share his fortune or anything else
with her without being unhappy; but who can describe the feelings of
an enthusiast whose wife remains motionless at one of Shakspeare’s
plays?—at the sight of the ocean or the Alps?</p>

<p>“These inequalities of taste and disposition become a true source
of misery in proportion as we have leisure to give scope to our
imagination. In active life, in the pursuits of agriculture, commerce,
or manufactures, they are hardly noticed. What time, I would ask
you, has one of our young men to be unhappy?—when in the morning he
rises, to read the papers; then takes his breakfast, at which his fair
partner presents him with her own white hands two cups of hyson or
pekoe, with the trifling addition of a steak or a chop; then goes to
his counting-room, where he remains until one; then passes the hour
from one till two on ’change; then returns home to eat his beef and
pudding, which he accomplishes in about ten minutes; then returns once
more to his counting-room, where he remains till sunset; then comes
home to swallow his two or three cups of tea; after which, if there be
no political <em>caucas</em>, no evening lecture, or late arrival of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
mail, he is heartily glad to go to rest, in order to gather strength
for the work of the next day? What can it matter to him whether his
wife be sentimental? whether she have imagination or taste? whether she
be an admirer of the drama?</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“‘What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?’</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Our <em>fashionable</em> men,” continued he, with a sarcastic
contraction of his lips, which was his usual substitute for a smile,
“are less fortunate. They are not permitted to go to bed when they
are tired. <em>Society</em> has claims upon them; they must contribute
their share to the entertainment of the evening. Accordingly, they are
obliged to wash and dress, put on kid gloves, and prepare, in every
other respect, for the sacrifice, to which they are led by their wives
like so many sheep to the slaughter-house. Being, as married people,
excluded from dancing, and cards being abolished among us, they are
obliged to amuse themselves with taking refreshments, which I believe
they always do, until, towards ten, a regular supper rewards their
patience; after which the majority of the company get into their hacks,
swearing that it was a capital entertainment, at which there was plenty
to eat, and a great profusion of choice and exquisite wines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“As regards our women, they are, with the exception of the time
consumed at meals, the whole day left to themselves; a circumstance
which is not calculated to render their existence a happy one, unless
they are blessed with children to break in upon its monotony, and
afford fresh scope for their affections. Hence our women love their
offspring passionately; while for their husbands they feel a sort of
half-distant respect, wholly opposed to that tender familiarity without
which it is impossible to penetrate into a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>“In this manner our men are cheated—or rather cheat themselves—out
of the poetical part of matrimony; but are also saved from a vast deal
of mortification. At any rate, our hard-featured, industrious Yankees,
who are accustomed to act from principle, not from impulse,—from
conviction, not from inclination,—have shown themselves worthy of
living under free institutions, which seem to compensate them for the
absence of those pleasures which a higher degree of refinement and an
abundance of leisure secure to the higher classes of Europe; and the
remark of a celebrated European statesman was, perhaps, a wise one,
when he said ‘that a people is fit for liberal institutions in exactly
the same proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> as its whole time is employed in satisfying its
physical wants.’”</p>

<p>“But how is it possible,” demanded I, “that with all this political
liberty, and the constant occupation of all classes of society, you
should have become reduced to a degree of social bondage, of which
no city in Europe, and scarcely one in Asia, furnishes an example?
Remember, I have not yet forgotten the advice you gave me at the
concert.”</p>

<p>“All this,” replied he, “is owing to the excessive prudence which
pervades our higher society, and which, in reality, makes them believe
that no European can fathom them. Our gentlemen are, indeed, not
endowed with the faculty of second sight; but they have what they
call ‘second thoughts,’ a sort of <i lang="fr">arrière pensée</i>, which it is
not always easy to decipher, and is frequently the whole substitute
for profundity or research. Thus they have always two motives for one
and the same act,—a public and a <em>private</em> one; and, as many
Europeans who come here to study our character are ingenuous enough
to consider one motive quite sufficient for each act, it is an even
chance they are mistaken, whether they have a view to our private
or public motives. If you stay long enough among us, you will hear
morality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> politics, and even religion advocated from more than one
<em>prudent</em> motive. High, exalted views, or enthusiasm for one or
the other of these all-important subjects, you will, indeed, meet
with occasionally; but, in general, we look upon all such sentiments
as unhealthy, feverish, unbecoming a ‘calm,’ ‘sober,’ ‘calculating’
people. We delight in prose, though we frequently <em>talk</em> poetry.
Poetry with us is a <em>public</em> consideration, for which reason its
place is usually the newspapers. It is food for the multitude; our
<em>private</em> motives seldom rise beyond a clear view of our own
immediate interests. In the inimitable language of one of our most
fashionable young ladies, we <em>admire</em> roast beef, and <em>dote</em>
on oyster pies.</p>

<p>“This is in some degree the origin of our cant in morality and
religion, which our politicians, when there is no other absorbing
topic, such as manufactures, commerce, fisheries, &amp;c. employ for
the purpose of ‘making a hit.’ In the absence of enthusiasm, which
would inspire them with natural eloquence, they seek to maintain
themselves at a certain elevation by pressing hard on lofty topics;
having no wings, they endeavour to support themselves in the air by a
<em>parachute</em>. Thus the words ‘virtue,’ ‘patriotism,’ ‘morality,’
‘religion,’ ‘piety,’ are in every one’s mouth. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> these terms had
originally a distinct meaning attached to them, and to the mass of the
people they are still full of import; but, being thus used on the most
trifling occasion, they must sooner or later become degraded to mere
figures of speech.</p>

<p>“The same holds of our republican manners. You will see many of our
public characters wear the garb of humility in the presence of their
meanest fellow-citizens; they carry their own <i lang="fr">portemanteaux</i>
when landing from a steam-boat, shake hands with everybody on election
day, and, like <i>Hildebrand</i>, assume, when walking or standing,
an inclined posture; but let them once be elected, and you will see
them draw themselves up to their full height, exclaiming ‘<i lang="la">Ego sum
papa!</i>’ With all our democratic machinery, our Atlantic cities
contain more lingering, pining, ‘aspirants to honourable distinction,’
than perhaps could be found in any equal number of men in Europe.</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued he, “our rich people, who, in the absence of a
law of primogeniture, preserve their wealth by marrying cousins,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and our young merchants, who become rich by successful speculations,
are somewhat tired of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> monotonous state of existence. Many of
them have been in Europe, where their property has enabled them,
occasionally, to associate with the higher orders. They have witnessed
the importance attached in <em>civilized</em> countries to rank and
fortune, and are therefore, out of pure philanthropy, anxious to
introduce the same high degree of civilization in America. ‘<em>Do we
not see the world prosper around us?</em>’ asks <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Daniel Webster,
the great Massachusetts statesman and orator;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ‘do we not see
<span class="allsmcap">OTHER GOVERNMENTS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">OTHER NATIONS</span>, enlightened
by experience, and rejecting <span class="allsmcap">ARROGANT INNOVATIONS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">THEORETIC DREAMS</span>, accomplishing the great ends of society?’</p>

<p>“Now is not this Conservatism with a vengeance! Would an English Tory
have dared to make such an avowal before a British parliament? Where
would England be, if her born or chosen legislators had looked round
for precedents among other nations? What would have become of the
United States, if the representatives of the people, in 1776, had
held the same language? What better argument can be made in favour
of absolute despotism in any country, than that ‘other nations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> and
other governments, reject <em>arrogant innovations</em> and <em>theoretic
dreams</em>? The decree of the Emperor of China against the introduction
of Christianity is not more profound in its argument; and yet <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Webster is, in this respect, nothing but a plagiary! Arrogant
innovations were resisted in China long before the birth of the
honourable senator for Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“Such doctrines as these will explain to you, at the same time, the
views of our Whigs. Compare them to the principles of Toryism in
England, and the conviction will irresistibly be forced upon you that
the latter are a thousand times more liberal, and compatible with the
freedom of the people. How many measures for the welfare of the English
people have emanated from the nobility! But these <i>Whigs</i>, who are
just one or two steps removed from the masses, think themselves beset
by dogs, and are continually kicking for fear of being bitten.</p>

<p>“These sentiments will not surprise any one who has heard ‘the most
influential citizens’ assert that the republic has secured no great
and signal benefit to the United States; that they were just as free,
and certain classes even freer, under the British Government; that
there can be nothing worse than the present mob-government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> &amp;c. These
sentiments, I say, had ceased to astonish me; they only served to
convince me of the necessity of trusting to institutions, not to men,
the welfare of the state.”</p>

<p>In the present struggle for power, ambitious men may yet hope to
arrive at honourable distinction through legitimate means—through
the suffrages of the people; and hence the decision of every great
question is still referred to the latter, although in a manner so
distorted by cunning and sophistry that the people can scarcely see
the true point at issue. For this reason the United States are, as
yet, free from secret societies, private meetings and assemblies
for political purposes, and leagues of powerful families for the
furtherance of treasonable objects. Neither of the two parties, the
would-be-aristocratic or the democratic, is as yet firmly established
in power, or can hope to acquire and retain it for any length of time;
but it is even this unsettled state which, by some, is taken for a
surety of the continuance of the republican government.</p>

<p>Every institution, democratic, aristocratic, or monarchical, was
originally good, and remained so as long as it answered the purpose
for which it was first established. For this reason it is absurd to
praise or censure, in the abstract, either of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> forms of society.
The elements of each of them probably co-existed at all times, even
under governments the most republican or despotic: all calamities
which ever befel mankind arose from their misapplication, or from
the disproportion between the progress of society (no matter in what
direction) and the relative preponderance of one or the other of these
three principles.</p>

<p>If any of the two great parties which divide the United States, as
they do the rest of the world, should ever succeed in breaking up and
destroying the other; if any one of them were to establish itself so
firmly in power, as to make its political antagonists wholly despair of
overthrowing it by constitutional means; then one of two great evils
would necessarily ensue,—political indifference on the part of a great
number of industrious and wealthy citizens; or a lawless opposition,
not to the party in power, but to the <em>institutions</em> under which
they hold it. Something of the kind—at least the former of the two
cases—actually occurred during the latter part of the administration
of General Jackson; at which time a large portion of wealthy, and
formerly influential citizens, believing it in vain to make any farther
resistance to the sway of democracy, entirely withdrew from politics,
and frankly expressed, at home and abroad, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> conversation and in
public prints, their contempt for the government and institutions of
America. Now that, by a series of changes which it is not here the
place to explain, political influence and power seem to be once more
within their reach, they begin again to take an active part in public
affairs, recommencing their opposition to democracy with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>The government of the United States requires, more than any other, a
strong opposition, in order to prevent a powerful faction from assuming
a monarchical sway through one or more of its leaders. Democracies
and aristocracies may eventually terminate in monarchies; their most
critical moment being always that in which one of two great parties
has gained some signal victory over the other. The power obtained
by the conquerors is necessarily concentrated in the hands of a few
political champions; who, being on such occasions, for a time at
least, independent of public opinion, or having that opinion in their
favour, may dictate law. Such a moment is fraught with dangers, even if
the democratic party be the conqueror; the transition from democracy
to monarchy being far more easy than that from aristocracy to the
government of a single individual. The latter is, indeed, impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
until the aristocracy is completely absorbed by the democratic element,
and by degrees spoliated of its prerogatives.</p>

<p>For this reason a powerful aristocracy of family has always been
the strongest bulwark against arbitrary power, and the preserver of
liberty in the middle ages. But, in order that the aristocratic element
shall fulfil its high destination, it must have an <em>historical</em>
basis;—it must date from the origin of the country, and, like the
aristocracy of England, have contributed to the foundation of the
state. A mere mushroom aristocracy of money, taken yesterday from
behind the counter, possesses none of these essential qualities; and
is on that account neither capable of protecting the lower classes,
nor of forming by itself a powerful political party. What a commercial
aristocracy may do for the happiness of a people, even when reflecting
on its historical grandeur, we have seen in the example of Venice, from
the time the signory elected the chief magistrate, in 1173, to that in
which she stooped</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">“—————————— to be</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A province for an empire, petty town</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lieu of capital, with slaves for senates,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beggars for nobles, panders for a people.”</span><br>
</p>

<p>The establishment of a purely democratic government—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> is, of one
in which the democratic prevails over the aristocratic and monarchical
principles,—is an historical problem which, under the most favourable
circumstances ever combined, was intrusted to the American people.
These circumstances will continue to act for centuries in their favour;
and suppose the government finally to become modified, could such an
event disprove the fact that, as long as the republic <em>did</em> last,
the people were prosperous and happy, the nation respected abroad,
and its domestic affairs managed with skill and integrity? Is it an
argument against democratic institutions that they cannot last for
ever? Might you not just as well despise youth and vigour, because they
are doomed to old age and decrepitude? If it be true that all republics
finally changed into aristocracies or monarchies, it ought to make
the Americans only the more jealous of preserving the purity of their
institutions, in order that, if an aristocracy <em>must</em> come, it may
not be one of mere wealthy stock-jobbers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Come,” said my cicerone, “let us take a walk over to Charlestown,
‘the mob quarter,’ as our enlightened citizens call that independent
suburb of Boston. We shall have a fine view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> the city and the
harbour from Bunker’s Hill monument, the most classical object in this
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“How far is it now completed?” demanded I. “I was told they did not go
on with it from want of funds.”</p>

<p>“That monument,” replied he, “of which no one can tell when it will
be finished, is a sad proof of the preference given by the Bostonians
to <em>realities</em>, rather than to fictions of honour and glory. Our
people are not fond of the poetry of history. They seem to have fought
for liberty because it was a thing worth fighting for, without being
fired with that enthusiasm for a great and noble cause with which we
have seen millions of Europeans rush into battle as into a banquet-room.</p>

<p>“We Yankees are not like the heroes of antiquity; we are not ambitious,
and do not even think it worth our while to leave traces of our virtues
and achievements to posterity. We are not easily moved by historical
recollections, and therefore think it a useless vanity to erect
monuments for our children, in order to stimulate them to great and
generous actions. This is a new illustration of our common sense. Being
less exposed to invasions from a foreign enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> and less dreading the
aspirings of a powerful faction within, we do not see our institutions
surrounded by those dangers, in the struggle against which love of
liberty and of country become the absorbing passions of a people.
Liberty, with us, constitutes a quiet possession, which we hope to
retain rather by prudence and economy than by enthusiasm and courage.”</p>

<p>“I have heard a number of Bostonians,” observed I, “animadvert
seriously against the celebration of the 4th of July, the anniversary
of the declaration of independence; and especially against the reading
of that instrument from the pulpit, because it contains expressions
offensive to a power with which the Americans are now living in peace
and amity.”</p>

<p>“We do not wish our children to imbibe that tender affection for
liberty,” replied he, “which a lover cherishes for his mistress; we
want them to be wedded to it in the good old Puritan fashion, without
going through the tedium of a sentimental courtship. Our liberal
institutions are, with us, a sort of household furniture intended for
common use, well kept and guarded from injury, but no object of ardent
attachment or devotion.”</p>

<p>The total absence of enthusiasm among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> higher classes of
Americans, I found, indeed, one of the most remarkable features of
their character. They consider the democratic institutions of their
country <em>opposed</em> to national grandeur; and feel, therefore,
little inclined to commemorate events which could either flatter the
vanity, or excite the emulation, of the lower classes. They seem to
be of opinion that the people of the United States have full as much
liberty as they can bear, and that a little more would unavoidably
upset the whole. This will be considered as a gross slander on the
patriotism of the aristocracy; but it is nevertheless a conclusion I
have deliberately come to, after a long series of observation. Love of
liberty and of country I found infinitely stronger among the labouring
classes, who do not enjoy the advantage of finishing their education in
Europe; absolute contempt, and sometimes hatred of the institutions of
their country, among those who have had the means of spending several
years abroad. What is the world to argue from it?</p>

<p>The monument at Bunker’s, or rather Breed’s Hill,—for the Americans
mistook their position in the night, and fortified Breed’s Hill instead
of Bunker’s Hill,—was intended, I believe, for a plain obelisk, which,
if it were completed, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> command a most superb view of the city
and the harbour; as it now stands, it is nothing but a modern ruin,—a
lasting reproach to the want of <em>nationality</em> of the Bostonians.
Want of <em>public spirit</em> it cannot be; because the Bostonians have
given a thousand proofs of their readiness to make large pecuniary
sacrifices in order to further the establishment of institutions
calculated to benefit the community. The establishment of the Athenæum,
principally through the munificence of a merchant; the Asylum for the
Blind, towards which <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Perkins contributed alone ten thousand pounds
sterling; the great liberality of all classes whenever an appeal is
made to their charity; and lastly, the large sums paid annually for
the support of common schools and public lectures, do not allow me to
entertain the least doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>But, in the case of the monument at Bunker’s Hill, “the English
feeling,” for which the higher classes of Boston were always
distinguished, seems to have acted as a counterpoise; and to have,
if not absolutely prevented its completion, at least withheld those
sums which would have been readily contributed for another object.
The <em>Boston ladies</em>, who, it is said, have a good deal of public
spirit, made an attempt to revive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> national pride of the gentlemen,
but without effect; the outward respect paid by the Americans “to
the sex” being essentially different from that species of gallantry
which makes men delight in anticipating the wishes of women without
being regularly pressed into the service. The “appeal of the ladies,”
therefore, remained without effect, and a few of the forward ones
barely escaped being ridiculed in the public prints. “This is a sad
state of society,” say the disciples of Miss Martineau; “but all this
will be changed when the ladies will vote, and hold public meetings for
the propagation of patriotism.”</p>

<p>“If the <em>English feeling</em> of our aristocracy,” observed my
cicerone, “were to manifest itself only by the omission of expensive
monuments, it would, perhaps, less expose us to the censure of
our patriots, or the just ridicule of Europeans. But I have known
gentlemen whose highest glory consisted in not being recognised as
Americans while in England, and whose delight it was to pass on the
Continent <i lang="fr">pour des Mylords Anglais</i>. One of them, a youngster
of not more than twenty-one years of age, was, on his stay in Paris,
particularly afraid of being taken for an American savage. He spoke on
all occasions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> England as his native country—(our fashionable young
men, you know, talk of going <em>home</em> to England,)—and commenced
and finished his sentences with ‘<i lang="fr">Nous autres en Angleterre</i>,’
‘<i lang="fr">nous autres à Londres</i>,’ &amp;c. In the travellers’ books he signed
himself <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***; ‘<i lang="fr">Rentier de Londres</i>;’ his clothes were made
by a London tailor, his hat was English; and he even imitated the bad
English accent when speaking French, though he could speak the language
tolerably well when he wanted to shine before Americans.</p>

<p>“A year or two ago,” he continued, “I met, on the Rhine, with a still
more extraordinary phenomenon. It was nearly in the middle of the month
of August, when I went in a steamer from Mayence to Coblentz. There
were a number of Englishmen on board, who, according to their custom,
avoided as much as possible every kind of contact with the rest of the
company. They were seated on one side of the boat, gazing on the moving
panorama of the river; occasionally ejaculating ‘fine!’ ‘pretty!’ ‘very
fine!’ ‘too much at once!’ At a little distance from them, towards the
stern of the vessel, sat, ‘solitary and alone,’ as a celebrated senator
has it, a gentleman in a macintosh, buttoned up to the chin, supporting
his body, which was bent forward, by a huge cane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> and keeping his eyes
fixed on the ground in the deepest meditation.</p>

<p>“This Pythagorean attitude and silence, which were admirably becoming
a thinking Englishman, excited the mirth of all the passengers, and
especially of the Germans, who ironically remarked ‘that the English
had a very philosophical way of travelling, always reasoning and
reflecting when other people are satisfied with the mere looks of
things.’</p>

<p>“After the lapse of I should think an hour, the supposed Englishman,
whose back must have ached considerably, drew himself up to his full
height, enabling me to recognise in him a young gentleman of my
acquaintance, who had gone to Europe for his health, and was at the
same time carefully improving his manners. ‘How long is it since you
left ***?’ demanded I, rushing up to him in order to shake him by the
hand. ‘Hush!’ whispered he; ‘I have been coming down all the way from
Strasbourg with these Englishmen here, and none of them has recognised
me as an American.’</p>

<p>“The fact is,” continued my cicerone, “our higher classes, in spite
of their continual croaking, have no other standard to go by but the
English. They pique themselves on dressing like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> the English, talking
like the English, thinking like the English, and behaving like the
English, and on having English sentiments with regard to politics and
religion. Some of ‘the aristocracy’ are even more orthodox than the
English themselves; especially with regard to the Irish, who, since
their emancipation, are much more unpopular with certain classes of
Americans than O’Connell can possibly be in a British assembly of
Tories.</p>

<p>“For the same reason have our aristocracy taken the House of Lords
under their protection; ‘because the English nobility is such a
glorious institution!’ ‘it contributes so much to the national
splendour!’ and there are so many high families in America
<em>connected</em> with the first people in England! They probably think
that, as long as aristocracy finds a stronghold in the old institutions
of Britain, there remains at least a hope of introducing something
similar to them in the United States; but they forget that, from the
historical aristocracy of England, to the nameless money-dealers of
America, there is a greater transition than from the substance to the
shadow of a thing. Incorporated companies and banks are as yet the only
armories that furnish weapons to the chivalrous knights composing the
nobility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> of the New World; and there is scarcely an American squire
that would not be willing to sell horse and lance provided a proper
price be offered him.</p>

<p>“Another generic feature which marks our wealthy <i>parvenus</i>,
while, at the same time, it furnishes a curious index to the human
heart, is the little sympathy felt or expressed with regard to the
enterprising Western settlers, and the contemptuous language held by
our ‘respectable editors’ when speaking of those unfortunate exiles
from the refinement of ‘the Old States.’ Mrs. Trollope’s caricatures of
the ‘half-horse and half-alligator race make the reader laugh; those
drawn in our own papers are calculated to make one <em>despise</em>
them. They use precisely the same language formerly employed by
British writers with regard to the early settlers of the American
colonies:—‘lawless adventurers,’ ‘fugitives from justice,’ ‘outcasts
from society,’ ‘dregs of humanity,’ ‘candidates for the state’s prison
or the gallows.’</p>

<p>“By these gentle appellations do the mushroom aristocracy of a few
trading places stigmatise the steady, laborious, enterprising race of
men that fertilize the Western wilderness, and create new markets for
manufactures and commerce. Scarcely a couple of generations removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
from the original settlers, they already play the old families, without
having in their ephemeral existence done <em>one</em> thing deserving
to be recorded in history; for we cannot disguise the fact, that all
we have thus far accomplished, all that distinguishes our people from
the idle and vicious population of Europe, all that has contributed to
our boundless national prosperity, is owing to the virtue, enterprise,
and perseverance of the <em>labouring</em> classes, and in no small
proportion to those very ‘adventurers’ whom our Atlantic satraps affect
to despise.</p>

<p>“Our higher classes,” added my cicerone, “seldom get angry at
foreigners for abusing their government in the abstract; but let
any one attempt to prove that there are no elements for a different
administration to be found amongst them, and they will raise a hue
and cry against the audacious slanderer. Tell them that they are ‘no
republicans,’ and they will feel themselves flattered, though they
may pout like some affected prude with whom a man takes some pleasing
liberty. But attack their <em>aristocracy</em>; say that it is a noisy,
shapeless monster, with many tails and no head,—or, what is worse, say
that you discover <em>no</em> aristocracy in the country,—and you will
set them raving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“I remember a poor, little, innocent woman who nearly fainted at a
duke’s telling her that he had understood there was no <i lang="fr">noblesse</i>
in America; but merely an educated (?) wealthy <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>.
Poor thing! she little expected such a mortification; and from such
a quarter too! And yet she was a great stickler for human rights;
just like some fashionable reformer, who can see no reason for the
extraordinary prerogatives of the nobility, but is wide awake to the
chasm which separates <em>him</em> from the multitude.</p>

<p>“We may safely call ourselves the vainest people on earth,” concluded
my cicerone, “and yet we dare not have an opinion which is not
sanctioned abroad. We constantly refer each other’s manners, doctrines,
and principles to those which are current in Europe; but, when an
European ventures to imitate our example, we cannot contain our wrath
at his impertinence. We do not object to the standard of comparison,
but to the comparison itself; because we claim for ourselves the
exclusive faculty of arriving at just conclusions. Our best society is
but a sorry caricature of that of Europe, and yet we get angry when an
European attempts to depict it. Our fate is indeed the most singular.
No one can understand us; and yet we are constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> talking about
ourselves, and throwing out hints as to where observers may look for an
explanation of our manners. The good people of England especially seem,
in reference to us, to be in precisely the same predicament as <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Johnson was with regard to the Scotch,—the more we talk, the less they
know about us.”</p>

<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, Act iii. Scene 1.<br>
</p>


<p>To-day I dined with an English gentleman, who had been settled a great
number of years in the country, and was married to an American lady of
very good family.</p>

<p>The company was composed principally of merchants and manufacturers,
with an admixture of a few travelling; agents of British commercial
houses, whom it was not difficult to recognise as the lions of
the party. They were not, properly speaking, members of the first
society, because foreigners who are once married and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> settled in the
country seldom belong to it, unless they are immensely rich; but
they thought themselves nevertheless considerably above the second,
not one of them having accepted an invitation to the latter for the
last six months,—preferring infinitely no society at all to the
degradation of mixing with inferior persons. Besides, one of them,
having of late moved into “a more respectable neighbourhood,” was
preparing to entertain his new fashionable acquaintance with a large,
sumptuous party, which he hoped would at once open to his sons and
daughters—“the old man and woman” are not so easily promoted—the road
to the highest circles.</p>

<p>Dinner, which was one of the plainest I ever made in the United States,
was served in the usual manner; only that the gentleman of the house
piqued himself on having everything cooked in the true English fashion.
I believe he had a beef-steak brought upon the table for the sole
purpose of showing the difference between the English and American ways
of dressing it. “This is an English steak,” said he; “at least you do
not see it besmeared with rancid butter, and N.B. cooked with Liverpool
coal.” The <em>roast beef</em> was recommended in the same manner, as
being “roasted in the true English style;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> and the same was said of
the parboiled vegetables, and at last of the fire-proof pudding.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said one of the gentlemen, who was an American at the head of
a large manufacturing establishment, “none of our friends is troubled
with dyspepsia.”</p>

<p>“I like the English kitchen better than any other,” replied our
entertainer, “whatever preference my friends may give to the French or
Italian.”</p>

<p>“At any rate it is preferable to the American,” observed another
Englishman.</p>

<p>“And if not that, we at least know how to eat,” remarked another.</p>

<p>“That,” said our host, “no one will deny. The custom of eating against
time exists only in America.”</p>

<p>“Why,” observed the manufacturer peevishly, “I have seen many an
Englishman, sitting down at our public tables, play as good a knife and
fork, and as quickly too, as one of our ‘natives.’”</p>

<p>“That was done in self-defence,” cried the Englishman, “if it was done
at all.”</p>

<p>“If the custom of dining at <i lang="fr">tables d’hôte</i> existed in England,”
rejoined the manufacturer, “your people would soon learn <em>speed</em>
and <em>ingenuity</em> in eating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“I hope, sir, such a custom will never be introduced.”</p>

<p>“And then you forget that at a public table in America you frequently
meet with people who, in England, would be content to make their dinner
at a beef-shop.”</p>

<p>“I often suspected something of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, this is a republican country; we have no <em>public</em>
distinction of classes.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for you.”</p>

<p>“But is it not very strange,” observed the manufacturer, somewhat
angrily, “that you Englishmen, who come here for no other purpose in
the world but to make money, who ‘underwork and undersell’ us wherever
you can, should be constantly railing against this country? I have seen
Scotchmen, Irishmen, Frenchmen, and Germans who were all satisfied to
live amongst us and acquire property; but I do not remember a single
Englishman that was not constantly talking of the superiority of
England over America. The English are the only foreigners that never
become <i lang="fr">bonâ fide</i> citizens. They always have a leaning towards
their own country, however they may have forsworn their sovereign, and
pledged fidelity and allegiance to the United States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“I consider all you have said as highly in our favour,” said our host.</p>

<p>“But I do not,” remarked the manufacturer. “I consider it downright
perjury to come and settle amongst us,—to apply for the privileges of
citizenship,—to go through the requisite formalities,—to pledge an
oath of allegiance to the country,—to renounce publicly one’s former
sovereign,—to exercise all the rights of native Americans conferred by
these acts,—and then, after all, to remain a foreigner at heart, and
to abuse this country whenever an opportunity presents itself of doing
so with impunity. If you dislike this country so much, why do you stay
in it?”</p>

<p>“Because I cannot do better,” replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>“That’s an old, but nevertheless a good one,” remarked one of the
company.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the manufacturer, “we know <em>your</em> principles well
enough. Your John-Bullism is past redemption.’”</p>

<p>“I trust it is,” said the gentleman, colouring to his ears. “Nothing,
God willing, shall transform me into a Yankee!”</p>

<p>“But you are married in this country; you have children born in
America;—what countrymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> shall <em>they</em> be? They cannot be called
Englishmen, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for it; but that is not my fault. I will, at least, give
them an <em>English education</em>.”</p>

<p>“Pray, are you a naturalized citizen?”</p>

<p>“I have never perjured myself,” replied the sturdy representative of
John Bull.</p>

<p>“But did I not see you the other day at the polls?”</p>

<p>“I did not vote, I merely distributed tickets.”</p>

<p>“What a nice distinction this is; you did not vote, you merely
electioneered!”</p>

<p>“That was done from principle.”</p>

<p>“What principle can that be? What interest can you take in our politics
without being a citizen?”</p>

<p>“I have no interest at all in it. I merely do my duty by exerting
myself to the utmost of my power to insure the election of the
worst candidates, in order that you may the sooner be cured of your
republican notions.”</p>

<p>“If this is really your object, you ought to have been lynched long
ago.”</p>

<p>“I tell this merely to my friends.”</p>

<p>“Pray, do not quarrel with him,” interrupted one of the guests,
addressing himself to the manufacturer;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> “our friend has always exerted
himself on <em>your side</em> of the question.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact,” observed another. “Though you start from apparently
very different premises, and appear to have very different motives,
there is really no great difference between you in the end; so I think
you had better shake hands, and drink to <em>England and the United
States</em>!”</p>

<p>“England and the United States!” echoed the company.</p>

<p>“England and the United States!” repeated our host; “and may the latter
never forget <em>what they owe</em> to the former!”</p>

<p>“John Bull to the back-bone!” cried the manufacturer. “All in his own
house too!”</p>

<p>“But is it true,” demanded another Englishman, who, I was told, was an
ironmonger, “that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** is not yet naturalized?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said he, “to all intents and purposes a <em>British subject</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s no answer to my question,” replied the ironmonger; “a man may
be a British subject, and still for all purposes in <em>this</em> country
a naturalized American. I am a citizen of <em>both</em> countries. I hold
real estate in Nova Scotia and in the United States.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not hold it according to law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” ejaculated the ironmonger, “who cares for that? Millions of
acres of land in this country belong to foreigners.”</p>

<p>“But you cannot be a <i lang="fr">bonâ fide</i> holder of real estate in the
United States without being a citizen, and you cannot become a citizen
without renouncing all allegiance to foreign countries. You must have
perjured yourself with regard to England or America.”</p>

<p>“Poh! poh! Talk of perjury in such matters! It’s a sort of custom-house
oath which binds a person no farther than his word. I would not be
such a fool as to give up my rights as a British subject. Times may
change;—would you have me put all my eggs into one basket?”</p>

<p>“A nice creed this!” cried the manufacturer; “and such are the men that
govern our elections! And you vote just like the rest of us?”</p>

<p>“And why should I not?”</p>

<p>“Pray, don’t quarrel,” said the same mediator that had before
reconciled the manufacturer with our host; “<em>he</em>, too, votes on
<em>your</em> side. Why do you scrutinize his motives if his <em>acts</em>
coincide with your own? <em>England and the United States!</em> I
say,—<em>their interests are one and the same; may they never be
divided by party spirit</em>!”</p>

<p>This toast was drunk with all the honours;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> after which the gentleman
of the house rose, and made, as far as I can recollect, the following
<em>speech</em>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Gentlemen,<br>
</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you are by degrees coming to your senses. You
cannot but agree with me, that it is the best policy of the United
States to cultivate the friendship of Great Britain. It is, I am
sure, the wisest thing you can do, after having been so foolish as to
separate from us. As for <em>us</em>, we do not care three straws for
that separation; we can get <em>along</em> without you.”</p>

<p>“That’s an Americanism,” remarked one of the company: “he is a
stickler for Old England, and talks of going <em>along</em>!”</p>

<p>“I plead guilty to the charge,” replied the host. “The fact is, I have
been so long in the United States that I have almost forgotten the
English language.”</p>

<p>“Go on, sir! Go on!” cried the company; “never mind the language.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I said we did not care three straws for that
separation; neither do we, for our annual commercial balances against
you are now greater than they ever were before the revolution. I
only wish we could get rid of Canada in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> same way. As for your
<em>independence</em>, it’s all my eye and Betty Martin, as the saying
goes, as long as you borrow money, and we are the ones that lend it
you. A man in debt has lost his freedom, and the same holds of a
nation.</p>

<p>“As regards the good understanding which exists between England and
the United States, it is based, I am sure, on the most rational
basis: the creditor likes to see his debtor prosper, in order that
he may have a chance of being paid; and the debtor does not wish to
break with his creditor, in order that the latter may not be too hard
upon him, and, perhaps, trust him again. This, I believe, is all
the sympathy which exists between the two countries at present; the
antagonistical principles of their respective governments admitting
of none other. With regard to myself, gentlemen, I can only say that,
as the partner of an English house, I have always found the Americans
an honest, clever, enterprising people; a little too enterprising by
the by, especially with regard to manufactures” (here he cast a side
glance at the representative of ‘the American system’); “but, as this
has done <em>them</em> more harm than <em>us</em>, I am not disposed to
quarrel with them. The Americans are, no doubt, our best customers;
for which reason we like to see them in Liverpool, Manchester,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Leeds, &amp;c. in precisely the same manner as we Englishmen meet with
more civility in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, than
in any other part of the Union. This is all natural enough; and, in
proportion as <em>trade</em> increases, our <em>friendship</em> must
increase with it: and as I, for one, am really disposed to promote the
latter as far as lies in <em>my</em> power, I will give you ‘The trade
between England and America!’”</p>
</div>

<p>The trade between England and America was then drunk in a bumper; when,
after sundry coughs and expectorations, the manufacturer rose and
delivered himself in these terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Gentlemen,<br>
</p>

<p>“I am a manufacturer,—I presume you all know what that means; and
I am <em>proud</em> to be one.” (To the host.) “I think, sir, that
without manufactures this country would be entirely dependent on
Great Britain. Our manufactures, sir, make us independent; without
manufactures we should still be the slaves of the old country.”
(“Oh, oh!” and cries of “Go on, go on!”) “But, sir, I will go
further; I will come to the point; I will go beyond it! What, sir,
would become of this country without manufactures in case of a war
with England?”—(Several gentlemen, “We don’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> war; we want
peace.”)—“Gentlemen, if you interrupt me, I will sit down.”</p>

<p>(“No, no! go on! Let us have it in true style.”)</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I have asked the gentleman what would become of
us without manufactures in case of a war? Here is a question! will
you answer me that? Can you deny that our manufactures are destined
at some future day not only to compete with those of England, but
to <em>beat</em> them? And as to the insinuation, sir, that the
establishment of manufactures has hurt this country, I look upon it
with scorn; and what is worse than scorn, with <em>pity</em>,—nay, with
perfect contempt.”</p>

<p>(Cries of, “That is personal;” “that won’t do, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***; you are out of
order.”)</p>

<p>“If I was out of order, I am sorry for it; I did not mean to be
personal; I only wished to state the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. The gentleman hinted that we have not enough
capital or perseverance to carry on that branch of industry; at
least, I understood him to say so; but <em>I guess</em> he will find
himself mistaken. If we have not enough perseverance, we have at
least ‘an awful sight of hang-on.’” (Shouts of “That’s right: give
it to him!” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> laughter.) “But, sir, I gladly reciprocate; nay, I
feel absolutely obliged to you for the kind sentiments you expressed
in reference to this country. I hope the friendship between England
and this country will be eternal; I mean to say, <em>I trust</em> it
will last for ever. England cannot but <em>profit</em> by it, and so
must <em>we</em>. Why then should we be eternally quarrelling with one
another. I can see no good arising from it in any shape; so far from
it, on the contrary, <em>a pretty considerable deal</em> of evil.</p>

<p>“It has been the custom of a few ignorant Englishmen to underrate the
American character; but <em>I calculate</em> the English <em>nation</em>
had nothing to do with it, and must, since Lord Brougham’s
establishment of common schools, have learnt the true character of
our people. But, as I always say, gentlemen, there is not the least
cause of enmity between us. We both speak the same language, and were
originally one and the same people; we intermarry and trade with one
another; and, in short, do all things which mark us as civilized
nations. On this account, gentlemen, and because it does not behove a
Christian people (as one of our orators said), even in time of war, to
harbour any ill will towards one another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I give you, gentlemen,
and I trust it may be a sentiment to which you will all cordially
respond,—‘Success to the enterprise of both countries; and may they
never forget <em>their common stock</em>!’”</p>

<p>“A fine <em>stump speaker</em><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> this!” observed one of the Americans.</p>

<p>“Rather too <em>Kentuckical</em>, though,” remarked another; “but the
fact is, there are so many <em>nice</em> shades of our meaning, that we
cannot express them in any other language.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I again saw my cicerone in the evening, and related to him the
conversation I had listened to, expressing my surprise at the continual
feuds between the English and Americans.</p>

<p>“This ought not to astonish you,” observed he: “most of the commercial
agents, who come here either to settle or to reside, find themselves,
for the first time in their lives, in what is called ‘the first
society,’ apparently on a par with our most influential, <i>i. e.</i>
moneyed citizens. This, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> course, strikes them as extraordinary,
and leads them to the conclusion that the first society in America
must be essentially different from the society called ‘the first’
in England or Europe in general; to which they could not, possibly,
procure themselves an introduction. This, as you may perceive, must
be the natural effect of their modesty, for which you ought not to
blame them, and for which I, for one, am rather disposed to give them
credit; especially as I have seen the same persons, who in America
flourished in the most fashionable circles, on their return to England
not even admitted to the society of a London club, but content with a
place in the counting-room of their employers, and a table in a city
coffee-room. Though occasionally thrown into the company of <em>our</em>
statesmen, they never approached, by chance, a member of parliament in
their own country; and, although here considered as men of ability,
they were satisfied with living in obscurity at home.</p>

<p>“As regards their political opinions,” he continued, “few of them, I
believe, have received a liberal education, so as to be able to view
our institutions with an enlarged, impartial mind, or to separate an
accidental evil from the general good of which they may be productive
to the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> mass of the people. Instead of seeing in our government a
practical illustration of the political doctrines abstracted from the
experience of all countries and of every age, they view in it only a
modification of the government of England, and apply to it the scale of
their own country.</p>

<p>“For this we can the less blame them, as many of our most distinguished
statesmen and politicians take precisely the same view of our
institutions; referring them constantly to the British model, and
considering nothing as legitimate which cannot be directly traced
to, or deduced from, a similar institution in Great Britain. If you
believe them, no other people but the English are born with a political
understanding or forecast: why then should the English, who come here,
not apply the same doctrines also to the Americans? and why should they
not, occasionally, join our own fashionable people in depreciating the
advantages of our government, and speak disrespectfully of those whom
ourselves are accustomed to treat with so little ceremony?</p>

<p>“When the English, who come here to live among us, declare our
government a mere experiment, and our institutions destructive to the
ends of society, they re-echo but the sentiments of our first people,
whom they are obliged to imitate if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> they wish to be considered
fashionable; for, believe me, an Englishman who would praise our
government, and who in consequence would be suspected of Radicalism,
would be infinitely less popular in Boston than one who, by abusing us,
proves himself to have belonged to the fashionable school of politics
in his own country.</p>

<p>“The great evil of our society consists in its being constantly
acted upon by two entirely heterogeneous principles,—the democratic
institutions of the country impelling our people one way, while the
aristocratic aspirings of the upper classes communicate to them an
impulse in the opposite direction. The resulting motion, therefore, is
neither <em>straight forward</em>, nor directly ascending; but a sort of
compromising diagonal, which in the inimitable language of our people
is characteristically called ‘slantendicular.’</p>

<p>“This is the great historical origin of the doctrine of double motives
which sways our best society; and which is, perhaps, the principal
cause of all the incongruities, contradictions, and downright
absurdities for which we have been ridiculed by Europeans. I, for
my own part, tell you frankly that I dislike in the extreme the
‘slantendicular’ conduct of certain classes. I prefer a downright
aristocracy with <em>avowed</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> motives and principles, to a jesuitical
nobility of ‘influential citizens.’ You must respect the perseverance
and iron consequence of a Duke of Wellington; but you cannot but
despise the cringing pride of <em>our</em> Tory politicians. If we are
doomed to have artificial distinctions,—if we must have an aristocracy
after the model of that of Europe,—let us, for mercy’s sake! <em>import
it ready made</em>; the gradual process of growing it ourselves is too
tedious, and the minute details too disgusting, not to put the best of
us out of humour.</p>

<p>“I never want to see an aristocrat until he is ready to put on white
gloves; our ‘ungloved,’ ‘unwashed’ aristocrats are to me an object
of horror. No tyranny is more odious than that of an overgrown
<i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>. Being less removed from the lower classes,
their tyranny is more felt; and not being placed sufficiently above
competition, they are incapable of taking any lofty, disinterested
views with regard to the government of the people, whom they half
fear and half despise. These faults, at least, are among those which
are seldom to be found in an hereditary aristocracy, until it becomes
reduced to a position in which it is obliged to enter with the people
on a contest for power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Having told you so much about our ‘first people,’” said my cicerone,
taking a bottle from his closet, and filling two glasses with I do not
now remember what, “I will, as a <em>pendant</em> to them, relate to
you an anecdote which will throw some light also on our <em>second</em>
society. Only let us drink fast, and let me soon remove the glasses; I
should not like my servants to know that I am in a habit of taking a
thing of this kind. There is no use in making one’s self unpopular, you
know.</p>

<p>“The town of Boston,” he commenced, “if it were not already remarkable
as the ‘cradle of liberty,’ and the place where the first American
<em>tea-party</em> was given, would long ago have become so by the
hospitality and convivial talents of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>“At the South-end of the town, at the very spot where General
Washington raised a fort from which he forced the departure of the
British army, stands now, not a monument to commemorate the deed, but
an excellent hotel, where a man may get the best things in the shape
of viands and wines, if he be willing to pay for them. To this place,
called ‘Mount Washington Hotel,’ many an excellent family, probably
out of patriotism, retires in the summer, not only to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> enjoy the
sea-breeze, and to escape from the noise of the town, but also in order
to be able to say that they have spent the summer at a watering-place;
New Port, Longbranch, and Saratoga Springs being much more expensive,
and society too exclusive to enable people of moderate fortune to
participate in the entertainments of the season. The Washington Hotel,
therefore, is frequented by such gentlemen and ladies as have acquired
competency without wealth, respectability without family dating of more
than one generation, and a common-place routine of fashion without
having had the advantage of a trip to Europe,—in short, by such as in
Boston form the second society, and with whom the first society never,
even by chance, exchange any kind of civility.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding these apparent disadvantages,” continued my cicerone,
filling himself another glass, “nothing could be prettier than
this second society if its members could be made to agree amongst
themselves. This, however, is altogether out of the question, owing
to the numerous coteries and subdivisions to which it is again
subjected. Our second society, namely, has again its first, second,
and third rank, each of which is again subdivided into still smaller
circles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> which are again numbered; so that it requires the nicety of a
mathematician to ascertain what sort of company a man is likely to be
with when invited to a party. Owing to this trifling circumstance, the
members of the second society live with each other somewhat after the
manner of cats and dogs; making but too frequently foreigners witnesses
of their broils, and affording them, as will appear from my story,
occasionally an opportunity of acting the peace-makers.</p>

<p>“An instance of this kind happened last year, when a Polish gentleman
arriving in Boston, and finding the town too hot in the summer,
was induced to take up his residence at the ‘Washington Hotel,’
which he was told, and with great justice too, furnished excellent
accommodations at moderate prices, and commanded a fine view of the
harbour.</p>

<p>“Scarcely had he removed thither, before his being announced ‘as a
count,’ ‘a real count,’ ‘a count that was <em>known</em> to be a count,’
and who had brought letters proving him to be ‘every inch a count,’
caused such a sensation in the house, that the ladies refused to eat,
drink, and even <em>talk</em>, except in company of ‘the count.’ The
count could not but be flattered by these attentions, and in turn
omitted nothing by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> to testify his gratitude. He listened with
the utmost patience to the accounts of their chivalrous ancestors,—for
in Boston even the second society have <em>ancestors</em>,—sat without
opening his lips when they mutually abused one another, and with
incredible skill managed to remain on good terms with the various
sets, divisions, and subdivisions, whose every-day regret it was to be
obliged, ‘owing to the ridiculous American custom,’ <em>to dine together
at the same table</em>.</p>

<p>“At last the melancholy hour drew near when the count was about to
depart. When this sad intelligence was received, the ladies, with that
tenderness which belongs to their sex, and the peculiar generosity
which marks ‘the second society,’ determined to pay to the count a
tribute of their respect, and accordingly met in conclave to consult
as to the best manner of manifesting their sentiments. At first, the
first section of the second society met, and agreed to give the count
<em>a ball</em>. Then came the second, then the third, then again the
<i lang="fr">élite</i> of each section; and, wonderful! on this subject they all
agreed.</p>

<p>“It was therefore intimated to the count that he must defer his
departure until after the ball, to which the cavalier readily
consented; assuring the ladies that their kindness should be engraven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
on his heart, and that he should never forget the amicable reception
he had met with in Boston. The rest of my story is easily told. The
evening was fixed for the party, the ‘ladies patronesses’ chosen from
each set, (because, the count having been polite to all, none could
very well be omitted,) and invitations sent out to three or four
hundred people to pay to the count the tribute due to his rank and
quality.</p>

<p>“At last the appointed evening arrived. The ball was superb,—the
hall magnificently decorated,—the music exquisite,—the refreshments
in excellent taste and in the greatest profusion. There was also a
supper;—not indeed equal to one of Crockford’s, but, notwithstanding,
nice, delicate, blending the French with the English art of cookery,
and arranged in a style worthy of a <em>prince</em>. The selection
of madeira and sherry corresponded with the supper; and there was
a profusion of iced champaign for the ladies. The whole went off
prosperously, with the exception of a single mistake; which, however,
the count did not discover till the next morning, when the landlord,
stepping into his room, presented him with a small piece of paper
containing the disagreeable item of—</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“‘To Ball, 1000 dollars.’</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“The count was stupified,—changed colour,—declared that the ball had
been given to him, and that he had nothing to do with settling the bill.</p>

<p>“The landlord withdrew; handed the bill to the ‘ladies patronesses,’
and respectfully demanded an explanation. Hereupon a grand meeting of
all the sets was immediately convened, at which the best understanding
prevailed throughout, the whole assembly coming to the unanimous
resolution ‘that the count was a shabby fellow.’</p>

<p>“The day following, the count paid the bill and quitted the hotel,
without leaving a single p. p. c. for any of its inmates.”</p>

<p>Here my cicerone finished his glass, locked the bottle and the empty
tumblers carefully up in the closet, and, having put the key in his
pocket, told me in the most solemn voice that it was not the custom
in Boston to keep late hours, and that, in order not to lose his
reputation as a moral man, he was now obliged to wish me a good night.</p>

<p>I passed an evening at the house of a genuine specimen of a Yankee,—at
a sort of literary party, to which nearly the whole Boston tribe of
the quill were invited; the master of the house being well able to
act as president. My Boston friends, on reading this, will imagine I
refer to a gentleman in B***-street; but I can assure them that they
are mistaken. I do not mean a man who has at once been promoted to the
rank of king of literature, master of the pamphlet and magazine writers
of New England, by his wealth and the agreeable manners he acquired
in Europe; but a hard-working man, who served his apprenticeship in
a printer’s shop, and by dint of perseverance and talent became one
of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> powerful organs of public opinion, and a correct English
writer. His politics were, from the beginning, those of the Federal
school, but honest; his style clear and flowing, his arguments logical
and to the point; and he possessed a fund of wit and humour to season
the productions of his pen. In his younger days he submitted himself
to the arduous and unprofitable task of exposing some of the most
glaring follies of his countrymen; for which, though he became in an
eminent degree a public benefactor, he was frequently sued for libel,
and condemned to heavy fines. Notwithstanding these reverses he had
prospered, and become the father of a large family, most of the members
of which were distinguished for great ability.</p>

<p>On this occasion he had convened his friends and acquaintances in
order to communicate to them his resolution to add a new monthly
periodical to the list of those already in existence, and to ask their
contribution to so laudable an undertaking. He also told them that for
one year at least he was ready to continue it at a loss, remunerating
liberally the best papers on politics and <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, to
which he proposed to direct his principal attention.</p>

<p>The proposition was received with enthusiasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> by the whole company.
They agreed unanimously that such an undertaking was highly patriotic,
and that the time being was particularly propitious to an undertaking
of that sort; that the condition of the country, and the progress of
literature and science in the United States, “loudly call for such a
periodical,” &amp;c.; and, as a mark of their sincerity, pledged their
entertainer in a bumper of hock, which seemed to augur favourably for
their taste and judgment.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged in expressing their sympathy with
literature and the arts, I had an opportunity of observing their
countenances, which partook of the usual shrewdness of New-Englanders,
but were otherwise far from being remarkable or striking. Fortunately
for my democratic sentiments, they were all representatives of the Whig
or American Tory press; though some of the <em>English</em> editors of
that denomination would not, perhaps, feel flattered by this extension
of the fraternity.</p>

<p>What was most interesting to me was, the little case which prevailed
amongst them; none seeming to know his true position. They approached
each other with great caution, as if they dreaded each other’s malice.
I am sure they did not venture a single expression which they would
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> have liked to see in print. In addition to this, they watched
each other’s motions, and the greater or less degree of intimacy which
existed between their entertainer and his invited colleagues; in short,
they wanted nothing but tact and manners to pass for a tolerable body
of diplomatists at a provincial court in Germany.</p>

<p>I could not help making some reflections on those poor mortals, who,
like other players, “fretted their hour upon the stage;” though their
<em>parts</em> were not many, and the play but too often not worth the
candle. I believe I am not altogether wrong in asserting that the
American daily press, though its influence on national politics is
prodigious, is nevertheless in its composition, character, and moral
force, scarcely to be compared to the mass of talent employed in this
branch of literature in Europe.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a paper in any of the large cities of the United
States which has a decided political character—advocating some great
historical principle, and employing in its warfare other weapons than
common-place dialectics, and constant appeals to the passions of its
subscribers. The effect produced by the American papers is due to their
number; there being not one of them which can boast of a subscription
sufficiently large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> to make it a true representative of public opinion.
Their power is owing to combination. No great central institution
has as yet taken the lead; but they have a wonderful faculty in
communicating each other’s ideas, either by direct quotations or by
dressing up the same thought in a variety of manners. An American
paper, in fact, is said to be edited <em>with great talent</em> when it
contains in each number from half a column to a column of original
matter: the rest consists of extracts and advertisements. The latter
constitute the pecuniary resources of an editor; the subscriptions
being so low that, unless a “fair advertising patronage” can be
obtained, little profit or absolute loss must necessarily attend the
publication.</p>

<p>From this single circumstance the leading character of American
newspapers may at once be inferred. The commercial part of the
community advertise the most,—their interests, therefore, are sure to
be advocated; while those principles which refer to the higher branches
of statesmanship or political economy are rarely made the subject of
newspaper controversy, except perhaps in the Southern States. The
Southerners are the only people in the Union who study politics as a
science, having both the education and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> leisure for that purpose. The
Southern papers, therefore, are, on an average, much better edited than
those of the North; though from their higher standard, and the peculiar
composition of Southern society, they have comparatively a small number
of readers.</p>

<p>The practical men at the North call the Southerners, and especially
the Virginians, “Meta-physical politicians,” in contradistinction to
those whose immediate object is the increase of trade and traffic.
The Northern papers advocate each only <em>a particular part</em> of a
political system: one, a bank of fifty millions; another, one of forty
millions; one, a bank in New York; another, one in Philadelphia, &amp;c.
just as it suits the convenience of their subscribers. It is not the
press which leads the public,—it is the public which leads the press.
What is likely to succeed—that principle which promises to become
popular, which gratifies the peculiar <em>penchant</em> of the leading
portion of the public, is sure to be maintained, if not with spirit,
at least with great obstinacy; but a great truth, which is not yet
universally received, which meets with a strong opposition from wealth
and prejudice, which is calculated to benefit future generations and
not the present one, often pleads in vain for a single enunciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span> in
a daily print. The proverb, “<i lang="fr">Point d’argent, point de Suisses</i>,”
applies as much to the gentlemen of the press as to the hired soldiers
of Helvetia; with this difference only, that, once engaged in fight,
they do not always defend their masters with the same unalterable faith
and courage.</p>

<p>The fact is, a truth which clashes with the interests of a certain
portion of society is seldom introduced by men not entirely independent
in their circumstances; and for this reason a powerful aristocracy, or
an absolute monarchy, has often done more for the emancipation of a
people than could have been effected by the variously-directed efforts
of the wealthy middle classes. The history of all countries up to the
present day furnishes ample proofs of this assertion, and the state of
America itself forms no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The Southern planters, who, not without cause, are reproached with
aristocratic principles and sentiments, are nevertheless the stronghold
of American liberty, without which the variety of commercial,
manufacturing, and agricultural interests would soon produce a conflict
of principles, which would ultimately endanger the Union. The very
opposition to the Southern interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> obliges the higher classes of the
North to live in peace with the inferior orders.</p>

<p>The industrious labourer at the North has no better ally than the
Southern planter, who, from his position, is more independent, more
generous, and better able to protect him against the rich monopolist
than the <i>roturier</i>, who is his competitor. From the South
emanated all the democratic measures, together with the doctrine of
the sovereignty of the people as it is now understood, in the United
States. Southern statesmen advocated the rights of the poor; and broke
down the monopoly of trade and manufactures, which threatened to enrich
one class of citizens at the expense of all the rest.</p>

<p>There is a species of republicanism which may assume all the odious
features of aristocracy; and there is an aristocracy, in the true
sense of the word, which may act as a stimulus to liberty and national
honour. If there be one truth which the history of modern times has
proved beyond the possibility of a doubt, it is this,—that the wealthy
<i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, where it succeeded in obtaining power, has been
a ruder tyrant of the lower classes than the hereditary nobility
whom it deprived of their political influence. As my friend truly
observed,—the more nearly an aristocracy is allied to the people, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
more intolerable are its presumptions; the less are these qualities
redeemed by refinement, education, and that peculiar sense of honour
which, even at the worst stage of corruption, seldom entirely quits
those descended from a long line of ancestors. If Michel Chevalier
is right in believing that the nature of man is too corrupt to be
governed by a pure democracy, then I would, with my Boston cicerone,
prefer at once an aristocracy of family and <em>hereditary</em> property,
with chivalrous notions of honour and justice, to a cold, calculating
preponderance of moneyed men, which, though it may to a certain extent
stimulate enterprise and industry, establishes nevertheless a mean
<em>numerical</em> scale of worth, the most distressing of all to the
lofty aspirations of high-minded men.</p>

<p>The aristocratic <em>super-position</em> of society, as it exists
in Europe and in the Southern States of America, has far less
tendency to circumscribe the liberty of the people<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> than the
democratic <em>juxta-position</em> of different ranks and fortunes,
with an incessant <em>struggle</em> for individual distinction. In
short, I prefer the white-gloved democrat of the South, with his
<em>aristocratic</em> bearing, to the ungloved aristocrat of the North,
with his republican humility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> and his cravings after popularity and
power.</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Observed his courtship to the common people,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How he did seem to dive into their hearts</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With humble and familiar courtesy;—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And patient underbearing of his fortune,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As ’twere to banish their effects with him.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A brace of draymen bid—God speed him well!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And has the tribute of his supple knee</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With ‘<i>Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends!</i>’”</span><br>
</p>

<p>As I was thus pondering on the relative merits of the North and South,
I observed a gentleman whom I had once met in a stage-coach talking to
the master of the house in a manner from which it was easy to infer
that <em>I</em> formed the subject of their conversation. Shortly after
he rushed up to me, and, seizing both my hands,</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me?” exclaimed he; “we travelled together in the
same coach from Baltimore to Washington.”</p>

<p>I was glad to find some one to converse with freely, without being
every third word stopped by such phrases as these: “Why, sir! I don’t
exactly know;” “I sometimes think;” “I am half inclined to suppose;”
“I rather guess;” “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> should <em>swan</em>,” (for, “I should swear,”)
&amp;c.; or cross-examined as to my intentions, views, inclinations,
tastes, and habits, which I knew would be considered as absurd if
they did not entirely correspond with the stereotype patterns of the
leading moralists of the city. During my stay in Boston I have often
felt gratified with the attention shown me by many of its inhabitants;
and there are, perhaps, few cities which, in proportion to their
population, can boast of so large a number of educated men and women:
but I cannot refrain from alluding to the want of moral independence,
not only in their private and public acts, but also in their
<em>conversation</em>. I communicated these thoughts to the Carolinian,
who, seizing both my hands, exclaimed,</p>

<p>“You have spoken my very heart. I could live twenty years in this
city without feeling myself at home in it. There is a degree of
ceremoniousness, watchfulness, and prudence, even in the hospitality
of these people, which destroys that familiar conviviality to which
we are accustomed at the South. The same holds of the women. There
is a certain severity—<i lang="fr">une rigueur poussée trop loin</i>—about
the loveliest faces in New England, which acts as a disenchanter on
enthusiasm. You gaze, you admire, you respect; but you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> almost
<em>afraid</em> to love; such a distance does there seem between yourself
and the object of your fancy.”</p>

<p>From these topics our conversation turned on literature and the
representatives of the press.</p>

<p>“Our editors,” said he, “think themselves competent for the solution
of every question, whether it refer to politics or poetry, to the
settlement of the Western country or to Greek and Roman archæology.
Once armed with a quill, they care not whom they meet in the arena.
Fortunately it is their practice to praise indiscriminately every
book, pamphlet, or poem, of which a copy is sent them ‘for notice;’
except when the author attacks their favourite doctrines, or pretends
to be wiser than themselves. In such cases they exhibit an <i lang="fr">esprit
du corps</i>, and woe to the unfortunate offender that provokes a
power so formidable! Not only will judgment be pronounced on him
<em>editorially</em>; but also in an infinite number of <em>anonymous</em>
articles, furnished by the legion of literary twaddles which surround
our ‘independent press,’ and claim the occasional insertion of a
squib as a <em>bonus</em> for the amount of their annual subscription.
This species of assassination is considered perfectly lawful, and is
practised by lawyers, physicians, clergymen, merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> manufacturers,
and tradespeople of all sorts. Whoever subscribes to a paper considers
himself <em>the editor’s patron</em>, and obliges the latter to give
publicity to his dull lucubrations.</p>

<p>“An editor, in order to reject these voluntary contributions, must
be very independent in his circumstances, or possess a fund of wit
and sarcasm to make people afraid of him, as is, for instance, the
case with our entertainer; but by far the majority are glad to avail
themselves of these opportunities of filling their columns without
personal exertion or trouble. You know how the democratic tendency
of Cooper’s novels was treated in our prints; how the youths of our
colleges, and the clerks of our dry-goods-men, exerted themselves to
the utmost to counteract their pernicious tendency.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“I do not remember many of those newspaper squibs,” said I; “but I
think Cooper showed very little taste or good sense in answering them
at large in ‘<i>A Letter to my Countrymen</i>.’”</p>

<p>“And in republishing that letter in England,” added the Carolinian;
“making the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> public judge between himself and the American
people.”</p>

<p>“And yet, what remedy has an American author in such a case, except to
appeal from a small and prejudiced public to a large and liberal one?”</p>

<p>“I do not think,” rejoined the Carolinian, “the English public is much
more liberal than our own. But, then, in England every man sticks to
his trade, so that the criticism of the periodical press, and even of
the daily papers, proceed at least from persons competent to judge,
and who have made literature their principal occupation in life. If
it were not for English critics, we should not know or esteem our own
poets; for it is only after they have acquired a standing <em>there</em>,
that they are admitted into society in this country. I remember what
an American lady from this very city told a gentleman in Paris, when
she heard a certain bard was visiting the highest society in England:
‘I cannot conceive of it,’ said she; ‘he never visited in the first
society <em>with us</em>.’ ‘Then,’ observed a sarcastic Scotchman, ‘the
first society in England must be very differently constituted from the
first society in America.’”</p>

<p>“You are too severe on your own countrymen,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“I am accustomed to speak my opinion frankly,” replied the Southerner.
“How many of the gentlemen present do you think fit to edit a
respectable paper in England?”</p>

<p>“That is a difficult question.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all, sir! I will answer it for you. Hardly one besides
our entertainer, who, though perhaps no longer equal to what he
was, possesses, nevertheless, more business tact, and writes better
English, than any one of his colleagues. And yet all these men have
pretensions to literature, and imagine themselves capable of judging
the literary productions of others. What man of talent would under
such circumstances not rather appeal to England, and be judged by his
peers, than trust to the decisions of his countrymen? The greatest
praise of the American press is, after all, but a dubious testimony of
an author’s merits, even with a great portion of the American public;
while its censure becomes doubly severe from the circumstance of its
rare occurrence, and the great ease with which it may be avoided. I
remember an instance in which one of this gallant body of editors
‘cut up’ a book, and that too one which has since been republished
in England, merely because the author had forgotten to send him a
copy;—a tribute which no poor devil of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> writer ought to forget to
pay to those sovereign princes of literature, if he do not wish to
see himself damned. But, if the work has once gone through an edition
in <i>England</i>, all is hushed in silence; for, although we declaim
continually against British influence, we have scarcely an editor who
dares to hold an opinion different from that of the English public. The
love of independence is, indeed, inherent in them; but in such matters
a mere <em>declaration</em> does not answer the purpose.”</p>

<p>“And what is the usual career of one of your editors?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“That is easily told,” replied he. “A man fails in business, or is
otherwise unfortunate; he does not succeed in his profession, or has
had some other falling-out with the world. Then he turns politician,
and commences generally by being a democrat. Democracy is the easiest
and best commencement of a politician. He is serving his apprenticeship
with the people, as a young physician first practises on the poor
before he ventures his skill on those who are able to pay him. The
majority of our ‘most respectable editors’ commenced in this manner,
by advocating ‘the greatest good to the greatest number;’ but, once
brought into notice, the transition from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> Radicalism to Whiggism, and
from that to Toryism, is effected with little difficulty.</p>

<p>“You may always doubt a democratic editor’s sincerity when his
<em>advertisements</em> begin to increase. He is then sure of making
himself agreeable to a certain portion of the <em>commercial</em>
community, and to meet soon with the proper reward of his new political
faith. You may then expect to see him promoted in society and on
’change; and ten chances to one he will be able to settle with his
creditors. After that, he begins to differ in one or the other point
from the leading principles of the democratic party, (for it is seldom
that a man changes <em>at once</em> from a democrat to a Whig,) until by
degrees he renounces the whole doctrine as unworthy ‘of a gentleman and
a scholar.’ Then he begins his abuse against the <em>mob</em>, declaiming
loudly against anarchy and usurpation; because new converts to a
doctrine must show more zeal than those who have been brought up in it,
and in order to exhibit their contempt for the class of society from
which they themselves have sprung. These abuses are afterwards returned
with interest by those who have remained faithful to their cause, or
who have not yet had a chance of promotion. Hence arises a newspaper
controversy, which is neither calculated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> elevate the style of our
writers, nor to throw much light on the great principles for which they
are contending. After subtracting the personal abuse and common party
slang of our papers, there remains scarcely enough matter to elicit one
generous thought, or a single truth capable of adding to our political
knowledge.</p>

<p>“Our editors are so much bent on discussing men and characters, that
they scarcely ever find time for examining a principle; and hence it
is that foreigners not acquainted with our public men cannot form a
correct notion of our politics. It is our boast that Europeans do not
understand our institutions; but I believe the same reproach applies to
ourselves, and particularly to our editors. How many of these, I would
ask, understand the true meaning of aristocracy and democracy? and what
historical idea do they associate with these terms?</p>

<p>“Immediately after the revolutionary war, we had Whigs and Tories;
that is, men that were honest enough openly to avow their sentiments.
These <em>had</em> a political system, and defended it logically with
philosophical arguments. And I will be sincere with you: a large
portion of our public men <em>was</em> then inclined towards Whiggism,
or rather to a moderate Toryism, as might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> been expected from
a people principally descended from England, and versed only in the
British school of politics. These men, however, soon discovered the
impossibility of establishing, in America, a government after the
English model. Their principles and doctrines became unpopular; until,
at last, their motives were suspected, and they themselves held up as
traitors to the country.</p>

<p>“The French revolution had given a fresh impulse to the democracy of
the country; and the champions of the old school—the Federalists as
they were called—were obliged to leave the field to their victorious
antagonists. Since that period their party has tried to <em>smuggle</em>
itself into power. They assumed a variety of insignificant names by
which to deceive the multitude, and within the last few years sailed
under false colours. They are no longer the plain honest men who come
out with their principles in broad daylight; they do not advocate
openly and manly the system they once gloried in, but only certain
detached parts of it. They administer their politics to the people,
like some disagreeable medicine, in exceedingly small doses, in order
not to disgust the public stomach.</p>

<p>“The great majority of editors are, in every respect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span> the mere tools
of party. They do not set up or maintain a principle, they merely
spread it over a wider surface. Their <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> consists
in appealing to the passions of the multitude, upon whose decision
their success mainly depends; and the same is the case with our
statesmen. The democrats may do so without apparent inconsequence;
they <em>acknowledge</em> the people as their sovereign, and may do
them homage: but when a party, which agrees in nothing except in the
conviction that the people are unfit to govern, bends its knees before
that very people in order humbly to crave some of the offices and
distinctions in its gift, then I can no longer remain an indifferent
spectator; I feel indignant at the base conduct of these crafty
flatterers, and become ashamed of the principles of the party to which
my whole family and myself have always belonged.”</p>

<p>“You are a Federalist then?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, one of the <em>old</em> school; for I believe that an
aristocracy not linked with, but, on the contrary, separated and
opposed to the people, must for ever remain powerless; and that the
people of no country are to be won by empty praise and sycophancy, but
by the conferring of some substantial benefit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Our rich people do not even understand how to strike the lower
classes with the exhibition of wealth and splendour; a practice which
is rarely entirely without effect when that exhibition benefits a
large number of tradespeople. So far from seeking the appearance of
liberality, they hoard money in the most miserly manner; as if the
mere possession of wealth, and not the skilful application of it,
were capable of procuring them political influence. There is not a
branch of industry in which they are not striving to grind the face of
the poor, and yet they expect the latter to promote their interests!
Nothing but an entire stupefaction of the people can ever make them
attain their object. The people give nothing without an equivalent, and
are only rendered more obstinate by the fine speeches and flattery of
those who pretend to be their superiors. In one word, our aristocrats
are fond of power and distinction; but they are unwilling to pay for
them. Money is, and remains, their highest consideration; and the
acquisition of it the principal object of their lives. Hence the
privilege of making money, and of borrowing and lending it, has become
the rallying point of their party. How far this will assist them it is
at present difficult to tell; but one thing they may rely upon with
certainty,—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span> the people, though for a time espousing their cause,
will again desert them at the first clashing of interests.</p>

<p>“Among the Western hunters and warriors there are better materials for
a future aristocracy than can be found in the Atlantic cities. They
are, at least, owners of real estate, and possess the soil on which
they play the lords. In short, the persons who are now called ‘the
aristocracy of the Northern States’ must change their manners, habits,
principles, and education, before they can expect to gain a hold on the
sympathy of the people.”</p>

<p>“But why do you remain with a party with which you have so little
sympathy?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Because I do not wish to be called an ‘apostate.’ I am so far
disgusted with politics, that I will not have anything to do with them
hereafter. The great interests of democracy claim in every country,
even in absolute monarchies, the utmost attention of the legislator.
All wise statesmen, whether kings or senators, have been attached to
its leading principles; but men have ever been too corrupt to give it
a systematic developement. This circumstance makes me sometimes doubt
its success among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> us; though I, for one, am no longer opposed to the
experiment.”</p>

<p>“The press!” shouted the company,—“the press!” and the editors pledged
it in a bumper.</p>

<p>This being Sabbath, and the last day of my stay in Boston, I went to
the “first Unitarian church” to hear <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing, a gentleman of
wide-spread reputation in America, and of late considerably known also
in England. He is considered the prophet of Unitarianism in the United
States, and I am not disposed to derogate from his reputation. He has
undoubtedly contributed much to the popularity of the sect in Boston,
and to its spreading in several parts of the Union,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> where a large
portion of the population consists of New-Englanders.</p>

<p>I once heard a clever man assert, that the world stood in expectation
of a great man who should unite the three principal creeds,
Christianism, Judaism, and Islamism, into one, and thus bring unity
and concord among the different believers in one God. Whether such a
man would have to clothe his doctrines in pious mysticism, in order
to affect the heart as well as the mind, and to embrace all the
peculiarities of these creeds, he did not say; but, since I have heard
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing, I am inclined to think that he is the man, and that he
intends to solve the grand problem by philosophical <em>analysis</em>.
It is possible, namely, instead of inventing a form which shall
contain each of these creeds as a co-ordinate part, to make use of
the dissecting-knife in order to cut off all that is not perfectly
homogeneous: the remaining trunks, with their “sublime moral,” would
then so little differ from one another, that the one might be safely
substituted for the other, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. How much the world
would gain by such a simplification, I leave political economists and
female philosophers to judge, who perhaps are best able to appreciate
the advantages and beauty of such a system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The sermon I heard was one of the doctor’s best. It was “on the
character of Christ,” and I must do him the justice to say that he
handled his subject with great skill. It was a perfect epopee—almost
equal to the <i>Henriade</i>, only that it was in prose. The effect on
the audience was electric. Instead of the ladies fanning themselves,
and the gentlemen sleeping as they are wont to do at this season of
the year, they all looked “at the doctor,” and at each other, as if
doubting the reality of so extraordinary an effort. I expected at every
moment a public manifestation of their feelings, but was disappointed;
for hardly had he finished, and a psalm been sung by the choir, before
his hearers—who, I was told, were composed of the “genteelest” and
“most <em>fashionable</em> part of the community”—left church with that
peculiar English propriety and undisturbed countenance, which would
have led an European from the Continent to suppose they had never been
affected.</p>

<p>It is usual in Boston to make sermons a peculiar branch of literature,
and to discuss them in lieu of other literary matter at dinner or
tea, especially on Sundays. This practice, by which many an European
has undoubtedly been edified, I was to-day doomed to become a victim
of, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> a very nice family. I took tea at a gentleman’s house, who,
though he had seen a good deal of the world, thought it nevertheless
<em>prudent</em> to conform to the customs of society; especially as he
had grown-up daughters, whose prospects in life might have suffered
from an open confession of the liberality of his principles. Having
arrived at the conviction that religion is absolutely necessary to
the <em>moral and political</em> well-being of the community, and that
it is a powerful means of repressing the vices and passions of the
<em>multitude</em>, he espoused, on his return to America, that creed
which most nearly approached his mode of thinking, and put the least
restraint on his habits. His family were inclined towards orthodoxy;
but, the father worshipping at an Unitarian church, the daughters
followed his example, and listened to the eloquent discourses of <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Channing.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I entered the room, and, in the good New England fashion,
bowed separately to all the ladies, and shaken each of the gentlemen
present by the hand, before the eldest daughter—a beautiful dark-eyed
girl, with black hair and ruby lips—addressed me in the most solemn
manner in these terms:—</p>

<p>“Well, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***, whom did you hear to-day?”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“I heard <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Were you not delighted?”</p>

<p>I somewhat hesitated for an answer.</p>

<p>“It was certainly a great effort,” said the gentleman, observing my
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“But is he not a charming preacher?—I mean, is not his <em>style</em>
beautiful?” demanded the girl.</p>

<p>“It is <em>glorious, glorious, glorious</em>!” echoed the women.</p>

<p>“And the doctor is not only one of our greatest preachers, but also
one of our first literary characters,” resumed the young lady. “He
has written an excellent sermon against General Jackson, and a most
glorious article against Napoleon in the North American Review.”</p>

<p>“Is he also a politician?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and a most <em>glorious</em> one; he wrote against the tariff,
and of late also against slavery.”</p>

<p>“Why did he not write sooner against it?”</p>

<p>“Because he waited for the proper time, just after the subject had been
taken up in England.”</p>

<p>“Are you an abolitionist, Miss ***?”</p>

<p>“I was taught never to speak of it,” said the girl, blushing. “It is a
question in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> we dare not act, as we are told by our minister.”</p>

<p>“For G—d’s sake!” cried the old gentleman; “let us not have
<em>bobolition</em>. Those blackguards are already stirring up the
country in every direction, and will not be satisfied until they will
have produced a separation of the Union. I think <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing had
better turn his wits to something else.”</p>

<p>“But what induced him to preach against General Jackson?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Because General Jackson was very nigh involving the country in a
war with France, and <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing is opposed to war, on account of
its wickedness. It completely obscures ‘moral grandeur,’ and sets a
high premium on the lower qualities of the mind, such as courage,
patriotism, and the like. He is in general opposed to ‘military
greatness,’ and is just as severe on Napoleon, Nelson, Wellington, and
Jackson, as Pope was upon women; only he is not quite so satirical,”
observed the old gentleman. “He thinks those men will have ‘a very low
standing’ in the other world. Isn’t it so, my child?”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, father; <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing always speaks of Napoleon as of
‘the miscalled great man.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Then the French were right in calling him <i>le</i> <span class="allsmcap">PETIT</span>
<i>caporal</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why, the doctor calls Napoleon only a <em>third-rate man</em>!”</p>

<p>“Then, I assure you, he has been sinking the bathos in a professional
manner. Such a speech might have been <i lang="fr">piquant</i> some twenty-five
or thirty years ago at a nobleman’s table; but no one can venture on it
now without betraying the most profound ignorance of history, and the
most ridiculous conceit at the same time. None but great men do great
things; the saying and writing them is left to inferior minds, and
often to mere scribblers. Napoleon tamed the revolution, he changed its
corrosive nature; which alone ought to have entitled him to the respect
of the Tories.”</p>

<p>“It is the misfortune of our people,” continued the old gentleman,
“that they cram everything under the head of morality. Morality is
the cant and crack word of the place. If you go to our fashionable
churches, you will hear the fashionable clergyman preach ‘morality;’
if you visit a private gentleman’s house, he is sure to entertain you
with ‘morality;’ if you attend a public meeting, the ‘moral’ speaker
will address his ‘moral’ fellow-citizens on the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> ‘public
morals;’ if you listen to the partisan harangues of our professional
politicians, they will conjure the people ‘in the name of morality’ to
outvote the profligate antagonist faction, &amp;c. Morality seems to be the
great lever of society; the difficulty only consists in finding its
fulcrum.”</p>

<p>“I believe <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing is very popular in England,” observed one of
the visiters.</p>

<p>“Among the Unitarians at least,” replied the master of the house; “but
the assertion of some of his friends here, that he is the best English
writer now living, is, I can assure you, wholly gratuitous. We are
apt to overdo things on this side of the Atlantic, and are either too
lavishing in our praise or too severe in our censure. We always deal
in superlatives, even in common conversation; which is the surest sign
of our imagination being void of images. Everything with us is ‘most
beautiful,’ ‘most sublime,’ ‘most glorious,’ from a turnip up to our
ministers, lawyers, and statesmen; so that, on occasions when we are
really moved, we have no other terms to express our feelings than those
whose signification is already worn out by common use.</p>

<p>“As regards <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing’s merits as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> author, no one can deny, I
believe, that he is a correct and tasteful writer, though by no means
a powerful one. There is throughout his productions a visible want of
originality and strength, which a skilful rhetoric and a nice selection
of terms are incapable of concealing even from ordinary readers. His
ideas are less striking than the garb in which they are dressed, and
remind one constantly of some pretty little miniature painting, in
which the artist is more successful in the drapery than in the face. In
addition to this, he is, like all New-Englanders, prone to argument,
and in the course of it but too frequently betrays the want of logic
and sound scholarship.</p>

<p>“This is most apparent in his little pamphlet on Slavery, and the
annexation of Texas. He there ventured on a subject in which the
popular feeling was already in his favour, and yet did not set forth
a single new idea capable of adding strength to his cause. He merely
reiterated, and dressed in new garbs, the general argument against
slavery, used by European writers nearly a hundred years ago; and,
in so doing, but followed the example of hundreds of his countrymen,
who did the same thing at a time when it was dangerous to advance
such doctrines in America. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> naturally expected to see the subject
treated, not in the English manner, but applied to the condition
of the Southern States. I thought he would allude to the forlorn
condition of the <em>free</em> negroes at the North, and propose some
means of elevating their character, in order gradually to prepare
them for a rational state of freedom. I thought he would reproach his
own fellow-citizens for refusing negro children to be educated at our
public schools, for excluding them from our churches, our theatres, our
public houses, our stage-coaches, and even our burying-grounds! And yet
it is evident that, as long as the feelings of our Northern population
do not change with regard to the negroes, emancipation can do them no
good; for, while it gives them liberty, it prevents them from becoming
respectable,—it takes away the master’s whip in order to transfer the
slave to the pillory and the gallows.</p>

<p>“I expected <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing to propose a scheme for gradually emancipating
the negroes, without absolutely ruining the planters; but, instead of
all this, he contented himself with declaiming against slavery in the
abstract, and in appealing to the <em>political</em> prejudices of the
Northern people.”</p>

<p>“But,” objected one of the gentlemen, “<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> Channing, in his pamphlet
on Slavery, and in his ‘Letter to Henry Clay, on the annexation of
Texas,’ says that he is aware that these publications will make him
unpopular with a large portion of his readers; but that he is prepared
to meet their disapprobation, rather than omit to do his duty.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s nothing,” rejoined the master of the house, “but a display
of courage in times of peace. Let him preach the same doctrines to the
Southerners, or, as I said before, allude to the forlorn condition of
the free negroes amongst ourselves, and I will believe in his moral
fortitude. Many a clergyman in the United States has exposed himself to
being mobbed, and some <em>were</em> mobbed, for daring to preach what
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing published with the greatest possible security in Boston;
and yet those men earned no reputation for their martyrdom.”</p>

<p>“Neither did these men employ the proper means for abolishing slavery;
they preached revolt.”</p>

<p>“And <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing,” resumed the old gentleman, “the doctrine of
political equality. He pressed the subject of slavery on his Northern
brethren, not with the calm, impressive voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> of an apostle of
Christianity,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but with the malice of a political demagogue, jealous
of the mental superiority of the South. Riches he neither condemns nor
despises; but he is inexorable on the subject of leisure, which enables
the Southern planters to be gentlemen and professional politicians.
Here” (pointing to a little pamphlet lying on the table) “is the best
proof of his sincerity and courage. See what he says of the South and
North in his Letter to Henry Clay. If the company will allow me, I will
read the passage. It is worth perusing, as it contains an illustration
of the character of our leading people.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘I now proceed,’ says <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing, ‘to another important argument
against the annexation of Texas to our country,—the argument drawn
from the bearings of the measure on our national Union. Next to
liberty, union is our great political interest; and this cannot
but be loosened—it may be dissolved—by the proposed extension of
our territory. I will not say that <em>every</em> extension must be
pernicious; that our government cannot hold together even our present
confederacy; that the central heart (?) cannot send its influences to
the remote states which are to spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> up within our present borders.
Old theories must be cautiously applied to this country. If the
federal government will abstain from <em>minute</em> legislation, and
rigidly confine itself within constitutional bounds, it may be a bond
of union to more extensive communities than were ever comprehended
under one sway.’</p>
</div>

<p>“Capital logic, this!” exclaimed one of the visiters. “Do not pretend
to rule, and you will sway over extensive communities. And what does
he mean by <em>minute</em> legislation? What do the Southerners claim
but non-interference with their internal regulations? and yet, while
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing preaches the same doctrine, he stirs up a question which,
sooner or later, must interfere with the sovereignty of the States.”</p>

<p>“This is not all,” replied the old gentleman: “he contradicts himself
every third or fourth line, preaching union on one hand, and the
dissolution of it on the other. Let me read to you another passage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Undoubtedly there is peril in extending ourselves; and yet the chief
benefit of the Union, which is the preservation of peaceful relations
among neighbouring states, is so vast that some risk should be taken
to secure it in the greatest possible degree. The objection to the
annexation of Texas, drawn from the unwieldiness it would give to the
country, though very serious, is not decisive. A far more serious
objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> is, that it should be annexed to us for the avowed purpose
of multiplying slave-holding States, and thus giving <span class="allsmcap">POLITICAL
POWER</span>. <em>This</em> cannot, ought not to be borne. It will
<em>justify</em>, it will at length <span class="allsmcap">DEMAND</span> a separation of the
States.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Did I not always tell you,” interrupted the same visitor, “that the
doctrine of nullification originated in Massachusetts? This is but a
repetition of sentiments expressed here more than twenty years ago. But
we change opinions according to circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Hear on!” cried the master of the house. “You interrupted me in the
best part of Channing’s letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘We maintain,’ he says, ‘that this policy is altogether without
reason on the part of the South. The South has exerted, and cannot
help exerting, a disproportionate share of influence on the
confederacy. The slave-holding States have already advantages of
co-operation, and for swaying the country, which the others do not
possess. <em>The free States have no common interest like slavery
to hold them together.</em> They differ in character, feelings, and
pursuits. They agree but on one point, and that a negative one,—the
absence of slavery; and this distinction, as is well known, makes no
lively impression on the consciousness, and in no degree counteracts
the influences which divide them from one another. To this may be
added the well-known fact, that in the free States the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
politics is of secondary importance, whilst in the South it is
paramount. In the North, every man must toil for subsistence; and,
amidst the feverish competitions and anxieties of the eager and
universal pursuit of gain, political power is sought with little
comparative avidity. <em>In some districts it is hard to find fit
representatives for Congress</em>, so backward are <em>superior
men</em> to forego the emoluments of their vocation,—the prospect of
independence,—for the uncertainties of public life.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Under such circumstances,” interrupted I, “and with such an exalted
patriotism on the part of your <em>superior</em> men in the North, the
American people ought to be glad to find Southern legislators in
Congress; else their senate and house of representatives would contain
nothing but men of straw.”</p>

<p>“It is precisely that mental aristocracy of the South which our people
dislike the most,” responded the old gentleman. “They cannot pardon
elegant manners and superior education. But hear what parallel <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Channing draws between the South and North.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘What contrast does the South form with the divided and slumbering
North! There, one strong broad distinction exists, of which all
the members of the community have a perfect consciousness; there a
peculiar element is found, which spreads its influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> through the
mass, and impresses itself on the whole constitution of society.
Nothing decides the character of a people more than the form and
determination of labour. Hence we find a unity in the South unknown
in the North. In the South, too, the proprietors, released from the
necessity of labour, and having little of the machinery of association
to engage their attention, devote themselves to politics with a
concentration of zeal which a Northerner can only comprehend by being
on the spot. <em>Hence the South has professional politicians</em>, a
character hardly known in the free States.’</p>
</div>

<p>“You hear,” cried the reader, “<em>our</em> politicians are mere
<i lang="la">dilettanti</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘The result is plain,’ continues <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing. ‘The South has
generally ruled the country. It must always have an undue power.
United, as the North cannot be, it can always link to itself some
discontented portion in the North, which it can liberally reward by
the patronage which the possession of the government confers.’</p>
</div>

<p>“This, gentlemen,” exclaimed the master of the house, “is the manner in
which the doctor preaches against slavery! He shows the whole value of
it to the South, and then calls upon the South to renounce it, in order
to put itself on a level with the North. An <em>advocate</em> of slavery
could not have selected a better argument for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> pressing the continuance
of the institution on the Southern planters, and yet he expects them
to become convinced of its wickedness. He has, indeed, a most peculiar
way of exhorting sinners; he shows them all the nice things they may
get by offending against the law, and then says, ‘All these you shall
<em>not</em> have by following me.’”</p>

<p>“And what does all his argument come to,” observed one of the visitors,
“but this?—Our moneyed men in the North revere nothing more than
money; but, because each of us is determined to make money, we are
divided into as many different castes as there are ways and means of
making money. We, Northerners, have no rallying point; because every
one makes money for himself, and not for his neighbour. This, however,
is not enough to give us political strength; and for this reason the
Southerners, who by their slaves are placed above the necessity of
making money, rule over us by superior talent and education. This
is a state of things not to be endured; and, since we cannot become
clever ourselves, we must at least prevent others from becoming so.
With us, politics come after money; in the South, they take the lead
in all human pursuits. If, therefore, we want to get the upper hand
with those Southerners, we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> abolish slavery, or, in other words,
force the planters to make money for themselves; then we shall see who
can make money faster, the South or the North. In the North all work
for money; and, as politics with us are no very lucrative pursuit, our
<em>superior</em> (rich?) men will have nothing to do with them. They
prefer the prospect of money to that of political distinction, and the
actual possession of it to everything else in the world.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” cried the old gentleman; “that’s the point <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Channing
is going to make. We would like to become like the Southerners, if
we could do so without pecuniary sacrifice; but, as this is entirely
out of the question, we must reduce those who are above us to our own
level. In this manner we shall promote equality and justice, and,
in addition, obtain credit with the world for philanthropy and true
Christian charity.”</p>

<p>“You may say what you please against the doctor,” said the eldest girl,
visibly displeased by the turn the conversation had taken. “I shall
always believe him <em>a charming preacher</em>.”</p>

<p>“I am myself very fond of his sermons,” added the old lady; “only I
prefer reading them at home to hearing them at church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“And I,” observed an elderly gentleman, “do not like his explanation of
the Scriptures by their general scope, and the disbelief of their being
written by Divine inspiration; though I heard his colleague assert,
that, <em>rather than disbelieve</em> <span class="allsmcap">THE WHOLE</span>, <em>he would
take every part of them</em> <span class="allsmcap">FOR GOSPEL</span>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now I must bid good-b’ye to Boston and its remarkable inhabitants,
who, I am afraid, have already occupied my attention more than is
agreeable to my readers, and, perhaps, to the Bostonians themselves.
“Common sense” is certainly the staple commodity of <i>New England</i>;
but I cannot say I have always found it in the <em>metropolis</em>.
The Bostonians are too much flattered by their own public men and
the press, not to be occasionally benefited by the remarks of “a
foreigner.” They all call themselves an enthusiastic people,—comparing
themselves to the Athenians; but, during my whole stay in the United
States, I have not known one of them moved by the tender passion,
which, strange to say, never attacks an educated Bostonian <i lang="la">mal à
propos</i>.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of that city never do anything out of season. Whenever
one of them falls in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> love, you may be sure he is quite ready to get
married, and that the object of his affection is a legitimate one. He
does not throw away his sentiment on some unattainable object, for he
husbands his feelings as he does his property. No man remembers better
than he the words of Bacon: “When it (love) entereth men’s minds, it
troubleth men’s <em>business</em>;” and, the latter constituting by far
the most important object of his life, it is comparatively a rare case
to see him <em>look out for a wife</em> “before he sees his way clear
ahead.” In this manner he avoids a great deal of romance and vice; but
all this prudence and calculation, this impossibility of being betrayed
into some rash inconsiderate act, lend to his character a degree of
hardness and severity, which, though it may admirably qualify him for
public life, renders him, nevertheless, the most unamiable creature in
society.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that the New-Englanders in general have a quicker
perception, and are shrewder, than Europeans or the rest of the
Americans. The Bostonians pride themselves on being “sharper” than the
Jews, and on preventing them from making a living in their city; but I
cannot say that this agrees with my experience. As regards quickness of
perception,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> they are certainly inferior to the Italians, and in part
even to the French; but they make up for it by their greater calmness,
which renders them less liable to error. They have not, as a certain
English writer believes, two heads; their clearness of judgment arises
only from the absence of emotions. Where men have but <em>one</em> aim,
and that a definite and finite one, they are seldom deterred from it;
so that the vulgar, who merely judge by the success, often ascribe to
them great mental powers: but there is a kind of genius which, from its
very elevation, and its necessary incommensurability with the common
mind, is doomed to unceasing strife; and with this the New-Englanders
have in general but little sympathy.</p>

<p>The great difficulty which Europeans, and even Jews, find in acquiring
property in New England, is not so much owing to the superior
business-talent or cunning of the New-Englanders, as to the practice of
“every man’s doing every man’s business;” which reduces the price of
all kinds of labour by excessive competition, and leaves no room for
interlopers of any description. No species of industry is deemed vulgar
or degrading; and, while a European or a Southerner is obliged to do
an hundred things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> <i lang="la">honoris causâ</i>, the New-Englander undertakes
nothing without a prospect of advantage or reward.</p>

<p>Another deficiency in the composition of the New-Englander is the
absence of humour. I have, indeed, been shown a number of persons
who were said to possess a great deal of what is called “dry wit;”
but which, after all, was but an odd way of expressing common-place
ideas. Their conversation, generally, wants seasoning,—the spice of
imagination and taste. In sarcasm they succeed better; simply because
they have more judgment than fancy, and understand dissection better
than composition. I shall never forget the definition which a Southern
gentleman, a member of Congress, gave of the satirical powers of a
distinguished politician of the North. “He has no imagination,” said
he, “no humour, no keenness of wit; but his sarcasm resembles a very
cold razor, which takes off the skin without requiring an edge.”</p>

<p>These are some of the dark points in the character of the
New-Englander. His bright ones are exhibited in his relation to the
community as a citizen. Few people have so great a respect for the
law, and are so well able to govern themselves. In no other country
are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> labouring classes so well instructed, so orderly, and, I may
add, so respectable,—in the <em>European</em> sense of the word,—as in
New England. Though their State politics have generally been inclined
towards Whig, and even Toryism, they are nevertheless the most thorough
Radicals in principle, and, perhaps, the only people capable of
enjoying so large a portion of liberty without abusing it. In addition
to this they are sober, industrious, and, with the exception of a few
straggling pedlars, from whom it would be absurd to draw a general
conclusion, just and honourable in their dealings. In short, nature
has done everything to make them calm sober republicans; but reserved
every agreeable and amiable quality exclusively for the <em>women</em>.
Not only are “the ladies” better educated than “the gentlemen;” but
also, owing to their entire separation from trade and traffic, more
imaginative, high-minded, and patriotic. If the Bostonians, and the
New-Englanders in general, have been remarkable for deeds of public and
national charity, I am inclined to believe it was principally owing to</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">... “th’ balm that draps on wounds of woe</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frae woman’s pitying e’e.”</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The women, in fact, are the real <em>aristocracy</em> of New England; and
I shall go to live in Boston when Miss Martineau’s plan is realized,
and the women emancipated from thraldom.</p>

<p>The journal of my friend I found was too long for publication. Besides,
I could discover his aristocratic propensities to grow stronger and
stronger in exact proportion to his intercourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> with the higher
classes; so that I was obliged to omit his notes on the society of
Philadelphia and Baltimore, in order to find room for his observations
on Washington. Two circumstances, however, I must not suffer to pass
unnoticed; his admiration of the Quakers, and his dislike of the Wistar
parties,—a sort of half literary, half fashionable, weekly convention
of gentlemen, at which a tolerable supper is added to a great deal of
indifferent conversation on ordinary topics.</p>

<p>“There is,” says my friend, in one of his notes, “a much greater
number of literary and scientific gentlemen in Philadelphia than can
be found in any other city of the United States; but they are, as yet,
far from forming ‘a republic of letters.’ As long as literary and
scientific men without fortune are merely tolerated by their wealthy
but less clever colleagues; as long as science and literature in the
United States are judged, not by their high intrinsic value, but by
the advantages which may result from them in the common transactions
of life; as long as arts and sciences remain without influential
patrons or public consideration, it is in vain to attempt their
promotion by pampering poets and painters with a weekly supper. These
‘literary <i lang="fr">réunions</i>,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> as they are called in Philadelphia, are
not calculated to put a man of letters at his ease, or to elicit new
thoughts by familiar conversation. On the contrary, they are stiff,
unsociable, full of that <i lang="fr">gênante étiquette</i> which prevails in all
the higher American coteries to the exclusion of mirth and familiarity.
The Athenæum and Garrick clubs in London contain daily a thousand
times better opportunities of improvement to young literary men, than
the Wistar parties of Philadelphia in the course of a century. There
are, in fact, no establishments similar to those in the United States;
though there are <em>very respectable</em> gambling clubs in New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and even in the godly city of Boston.”</p>

<p>“The newly established Girard College,” observes my friend in another
note, “will not prove so great a blessing to the Philadelphians as
is generally imagined. With the munificent donation of its founder,
and the truly royal splendour of its execution, it will, I am afraid,
become after all little more than an ordinary school of arts and
trades. The whole system of education in the United States, and the
tone of society, must materially change, before an institution like
the Polytechnic School of France can possibly succeed in forming
scholars in the higher departments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> of science. The peculiar foundation
and organization of Girard College does not seem to me to be much
calculated to improve the system of hand-to-mouth learning produced
by the material tendency, and the desire of pecuniary gain and
profit, which form the index to the character of the greater part
of professional men in America. The founder himself, though in many
respects a public-spirited, and in his own way a clever man, had but
a vulgar appreciation of genius, and a very high respect for money.
This is undoubtedly the reason why he chose none but wealthy men for
trustees of the college which was to bear his name, though it is more
than probable some literary men might have been found in the United
States, who, without being able to give <em>bonds</em>, would have proved
of some advantage in establishing and organizing a college.</p>

<p>“All I have heard of that vain old Frenchman confirms me in the opinion
that, even in his acts of generosity, he was but a vulgar plebeian;
never consulting the feelings of those he wished to benefit, but first
wounding with a rude hand their inmost soul, in order afterwards to
apply the healing plaster in the shape of a bank-note. Thus, he would
lecture one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> most faithful servants engaged to be married, on
the vexations and follies of matrimony; drawing in a brutal manner
the veil from nature’s holiest mysteries, and refusing to give him
aid and protection, until, perceiving that his victim, dreading the
consequences of his temper, remained, like some obedient cur, silent
at the abuses of his master, he signed a bank-check in his favour to
the amount, I believe, of some thousand pounds. I have heard other
anecdotes about him of a similar nature, from which I could not help
drawing the conclusion that it was his peculiar delight to make his
friends and clients forswear every other god and goddess before he
introduced them to the temple of Mammon;—or did the cunning Gaul
do so from a knowledge of the society in which he wished to gain an
ascendency? What reason, after all, had the Philadelphians to be proud
of such a man? And what difference is there between an American banker
leaving several millions of dollars to a rich and populous city, in
order that his name may be perpetuated by the building of a school; and
an honest English boot-black, who leaves an hundred thousand pounds for
the establishment of an hospital?<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>—I can see none; unless it be
that the act of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> former proceeded from vanity, while that of the
latter took its origin in charity and true Christian piety.</p>

<p>“The most interesting part of Philadelphia society are the Quakers;
as a body the most singular, as individuals the most respectable,
Christians in the United States. I do not here speak of their religious
tenets, which are sufficiently known to the world; but of the fact
of their being throughout a moral people, by mutual support almost
universally in easy circumstances, and from their habits of industry
and frugality seldom led into temptation. No other Christian society
is held together by such strong ties of affection and brotherhood; no
other set of men bear in their manners, habits, dress, and character
so strongly the imprints of their faith. They carry their religion—a
thing unknown in these times of moral and political advancement—into
every act of their private and public lives; and, though they sometimes
obtrude it in a manner not the most pleasant or refined on the notice
of strangers, show at least on all occasions that Christianity with
them is a living principle, not an abstract doctrine to be remembered
only on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>“I like aristocracy in every shape, whenever it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> has a solid
foundation; but I despise aristocratic pretensions in a vulgar rich
man. The aristocracy of the Quakers consists not so much in wealth
as in family, and this circumstance has given to the society of
Philadelphia a tone decidedly superior to that of New York. Though
much more exclusive and less hospitable than the New-Yorkers, the
Philadelphians are more agreeable and elegant in their manners. They
have more of the <i>à-plomb</i> of gentlemen. There is less motion
and more dignity in their carriage; and you can see, from an hundred
little circumstances, that the higher classes have the advantage of a
generation over the ordinary run of aristocrats in the United States.</p>

<p>“The Quakers, who are still among those who directly or indirectly
influence the fashions of society, have introduced a patrician
simplicity in dress, manners, and habits, which forms a singular
contrast with the gaudy ostentatious display of wealth with which one
is occasionally struck in New York. The Philadelphia ladies dress with
more taste than any others in the Union; they walk, dance, sing, and
talk better than those of the Northern cities; and their manners in
general are more finished. They do not study Latin and Greek, like
some of the New England belles;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> but they prattle French and Spanish,
and sometimes Italian, with tolerable facility. They cultivate the
<i lang="fr">agrémens</i> of society; while a great portion of the Northern
women puzzle their heads, and those of their admirers, with philosophy
and the classics. Yet it is but justice to say, that the women of New
England, even those of the highest classes, remain unsurpassed as wives
and mothers, and set, in this respect, the example to all other females
in the United States.</p>

<p>“In point of shape, the ladies of Philadelphia are believed to be
unrivalled; their necks, shoulders, and waists being admirably
wrought, and their hands and feet of the most aristocratic littleness.
Their complexions are not so clear and fresh as those of the women
of New England; but the expression of their countenances is more
<i lang="fr">distinguée</i>, inclining somewhat towards the Spanish. I was
also told that they had a taste for the romantic; several ‘droll’
engagements taking place annually, and a small number of run-away
matches furnishing from time to time sufficient matter for the
<i lang="fr">chronique scandaleuse</i> of the town. Things of this kind are
of rare occurrence in the North; though, as I observed during my
stay in Boston, there is no lack of imagination on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> part of the
<em>women</em>. But where should a young Bostonian find time to run
away with a lady? What business or matter-of-fact man is sufficiently
amiable for a woman to risk her reputation on his account?</p>

<p>“The Quaker ladies, in general, are renowned for their beauty. They
dress plainly, but in the richest materials; showing that their
aristocracy consists in substance, not in forms. The colour of
their dresses, which is usually of a light grey, is not ill suited
to a fair complexion; but the cut is too Old-English not to form a
glaring contrast with the Paris fashions weekly imported into the
United States. At the time of William Penn, the Quaker dress was not
distinguished from the fashions of the day by all that was inelegant,
odd, contrary to the prevailing taste; and on that account did not
obtrude itself on every one’s notice. But at present the case is
reversed; the very simplicity of the apparel becomes an arrogant
distinction, or may at least be considered as such by those who do not
look upon it as a part of their religious creed. Every man or woman
owes something to society, so that a total disregard of its established
rules and customs is usually considered as proceeding either from
extreme vulgarity, or a degree of elevation which need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span> not descend to
the level of others: a wise person avoids the dilemma.</p>

<p>“For this reason, and perhaps also because the French fashions of the
day are far more becoming to a pretty face, and exhibit <i>taille</i>,
<i>tournure</i>, &amp;c. to much greater advantage, a portion of ‘the
Society of Friends’ have of late relaxed from their original severity,
and adopted certain unobjectionable parts of Parisian millinery. The
selection they made shows their tact and sense of propriety; and it
is now a common saying with travelled men, that, in order to see a
well-dressed lady, one must either see a Parisian woman of the higher
classes, or a ‘<em>gay Quakeress</em> of Philadelphia.’ The gentlemen,
too, begin to trim their hats, and allow the fashionable scissors to
be applied to their coats, without dreading the immediate downfal
of Christianity. They are also said to have grown more attentive to
ladies; having at last arrived at the conviction that the hearts of
women are more easily attached by the silken thread of trifling cares
and attentions, than by the chain-cable of constant toil and sacrifice.</p>

<p>“A number of Quakers of Philadelphia occupy themselves exclusively
with science and literature; few of them are not members of some
charitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> or other association for the benefit of mankind. Yet they
have, from the commencement of the revolutionary war, been denounced
as <em>Tories</em>: partly because they did not take an active part in
the struggle for independence; and partly because, as politicians,
they have always been in favour of a federal government. If it be true
that family, education, and even property, are, from the principle of
self-preservation, inclined towards a strong protective government,
the Quakers as a body must naturally be advocates of Conservatism;
but in a country like America, where political principles and parties
are constantly changing, where the power of the government and the
opposition are so nearly balanced, and where the clashing interests of
society sometimes completely paralyze the course of politics adopted by
the Congress of the nation, I can see no evil come from a small part of
the community being attached to existing forms, or united, if this were
possible, for the purpose of resisting the rapidity of public events.</p>

<p>“The American government, as I have often said, requires, more than any
other, a strong opposition. The aristocratic and democratic principles
mutually excite and increase one another, like positive and negative
electricity in the metallic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span> plates of a galvanic chain; only, that
from time to time they require <em>cleaning</em>. Each principle without
the presence of the other would soon degenerate; and it is, in this
situation of public affairs, perhaps a fortunate circumstance that
there should exist at least <em>one</em> class of society capable of
representing with some sort of dignity the aristocratic element of
State.</p>

<p>“The time, after all, must come when the United States will have
their history; when the present will be linked to the past; when the
names of American statesmen and patriots will go for something in the
estimation of the public. Then the influence of family will and must be
felt by the people as the historical representative of their political
existence. This period is now delayed by the apparent opposition
between the higher and lower classes; but it will arrive as soon as the
real <i lang="fr">élite</i> of society will <em>join</em> the lower orders against
the tyranny of mediocrity—in the shape of the government of the rich
<i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>“The society of Philadelphia is, on the whole, better than that of
Boston or New York. There is less vulgar aristocracy than in other
Northern cities. Not that I mean to say that there are not people to
be found in Boston and New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> that could rival the Philadelphians
in point of ‘gentility;’ but in the good ‘city of brotherly love’
there is, probably owing to a seasonable admixture of a large
number of European, and especially French families, a higher tone,
greater elegance, and, in every respect, more <i lang="fr">agrémens</i>. The
New-Englanders are an arguing people, and annoy you, even in society,
with mathematical and political demonstrations. The Philadelphians have
more taste, and <em>have the best cooks in the United States</em>.</p>

<p>“There is nothing more aristocratic than the keeping of an excellent
cook; nothing so vulgar as not to care what one is eating or drinking.
‘<i lang="fr">Dis-moi ce que tu manges, et je te dirai qui tu es</i>,’ said the
celebrated author of ‘<i lang="fr">La Physiologie du Goút</i>;’ and, certes, no
Philadelphian will in this respect be found wanting in the scale. There
is a nice little house in Third-street, kept by a man, or, as I should
say, ‘a gentleman,’ who spent upwards of an hundred thousand dollars
in Europe in learning how to eat and drink, and who is now teaching
the same science to a select circle of his countrymen; charging them
for his trouble a little less than some of the quack professors of the
culinary art in New York and Boston, who think a dinner excellent when
it consists of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> joints, and show their barbarism by putting ice in
their claret.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> H—d, of the Mansion-house in Philadelphia, has been long enough
in Europe to know the difference between gravy and melted butter;
and if every American that goes to Europe to improve himself would
<em>only learn as much</em>, there would be no harm, and much substantial
benefit, arising from it to the country. I have, at his house, eaten
fricassees that would have done credit to old Véry;—his son inherited
the money, not the taste of his father;—and sauces with which,
as Prince Puckler Muskau has it, ‘a man could have eaten his own
grandfather!’ In short, one is more comfortable at the neat little
house in Third-street, than anywhere else in the United States. An
Englishman himself could live there without missing any of the luxuries
of his own country, if the bar-keeper were not a stupid old negro, and
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> H—d, jun. more of a gentleman than a landlord.</p>

<p>“A word in parting to you,” says my German traveller, apostrophising
the fashionable young men of Philadelphia; “you are much mistaken if
you take the terms ‘idler,’ and ‘gentleman,’ for synonymous. There
is a vast difference between a gentleman of leisure, and a vagrant
that walks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> up and down Chestnut-street, and stares women out of
countenance. You seem to think that a certain bold unabashed look marks
the gentleman of <em>ton</em>,—the fashionable rake, whose position
in society enables him to disregard the prejudices of the multitude.
You pamper your fancy in the <em>salons</em>, in order afterwards to
feed upon a common pasture. This is but a miserable way of imitating
the refined <i>roué</i> of Europe. If you cannot affect sentiment,
conceal at least your passion, or curb your inordinate fancy. There is
nothing so vulgar as imagination without taste.—And you men of family,
without fashion! study aristocracy in the classics, rather than in the
newspaper polemics of the day; or, if this should prove too tedious,
read the history of the Italian republics. There was a time in Florence
when every nobleman was obliged to have a trade, and yet Florence
produced the <i>Medici</i>; why should you be ashamed to imitate so
high an example? or are you afraid lest all your tradespeople should
wish to become noblemen?”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>One morning, early in the month of March, I left Philadelphia in a
steamer for Baltimore. It was a frosty cold day, and we were obliged
to have a fire in the cabin; round which the gentlemen—the ladies
occupying, as usual, a separate, more elegantly furnished room,—formed
at first a small, but, in proportion as the company increased, a larger
circle. The manners of the people had already a touch of the South in
them: scarcely would a gentleman approach the stove before those who
were already seated made room for him; an attention which, trifling as
it was, marked a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> consideration for the feelings of others,
which it is always gratifying to notice wherever we are. The captains
of the boats from Philadelphia to Frenchtown, and from Newcastle to
Baltimore,—the distance from Frenchtown to Newcastle is made on a
railroad,—were noted for their civility to the passengers; and, on the
whole, I do not remember having travelled more at my ease in any part
of the United States.</p>

<p>We arrived in Baltimore early in the afternoon of the same day; and the
greater part of the company putting up at Barnum’s hotel, I concluded
to go thither also. On entering the spacious bar-room I at once asked
for a separate room, and ordered my luggage to be taken up to it; but
was told “that I must not be in a hurry,” and that no room could be
given away to any gentleman without the bar-keeper having made his
“calculation.” I then perceived that the gentlemen, one after the
other, stepped up to him, telling him their names; which he put down on
a slate, together with the number of rooms they asked for, precisely
in the same manner as the burgomaster of some small town in Germany
would set down the names of the officers of a regiment which is to be
quartered upon it. It finally became my turn to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“What’s your name, sir?” demanded the bar-keeper.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***,” said I, taking care to omit the “De.”</p>

<p>“Are you alone, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but that is the reason I want a room by myself.”</p>

<p>“All single rooms are engaged long ago. I shall have to put you in a
room with one or two other gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall not stay here.”</p>

<p>“You may do as you please; but I cannot accommodate you better. We
have to turn away people every day, and we <em>must</em> serve our old
customers.”</p>

<p>“You had better stop here,” whispered one of the gentlemen in my ear;
“you will be satisfied with the house in every other respect, and I am
quite sure you will not be able to do better in Baltimore.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” said I to the bar-keeper, “cannot you manage to put me into
a room with only one other person?”</p>

<p>“I will see what I can do for you, but I cannot promise; I must first
make my <em>calculation</em>.”</p>

<p>“And you will of course put me together with a <em>gentleman</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“Nobody stops here but gentlemen; you need not have any scruples about
<em>that</em>,” replied the bar-keeper rather indignantly.</p>

<p>I thought it best to be silent if I wanted to sleep that night at
all, and thus quietly awaited my sentence. At last the bar-keeper had
completed the distribution of the rooms; and began to call out the
names of the gentlemen, telling each the number of the room he was
to occupy. When he called out my name he smiled; and turning to me
with a sarcastic expression, “We have to put you in a room with one
gentleman,” said he; “but, should you stay longer, we can to-morrow
give you a room by yourself.” I bowed in token of acknowledgment, and
betook myself at once to the quarters assigned to me.</p>

<p>“Also going to Washington?” demanded my chum as I entered the room.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am <em>obliged</em> to go,” replied he (with an air of importance); “I
am always there during the session of Congress.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have the honour of addressing a senator?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Or a representative?”</p>

<p>“Nor that either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Then you must have some business there?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; I am a correspondent of the New York ***.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you write the letters from Washington for that paper?”</p>

<p>“Precisely so; and it is a more difficult task to write a good letter
than to make a bad speech.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that, sir; you may often be employed in making the best of
a bad argument.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I mean, by improving what has been said by a senator or
representative.”</p>

<p>“Not only that, but it is <em>we</em> that give the cue to every
argument. Our representatives take up a question as they find it stated
in the papers.”</p>

<p>“And it is you that govern the country?”</p>

<p>“It’s the press, sir, and nothing but the press, which governs a free
people.”</p>

<p>“But is not the press liable to error?”</p>

<p>“All human institutions are; but <em>we</em> have such abundant means of
correcting and preventing it, that it is almost impossible for us to
be in the wrong. In the first place, <em>our</em> press has the money by
which (drawing himself up to his full height) it can secure the best
talents; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> secondly, our people are too ‘cool’ to be easily wrought
into a passion. We are a ‘calculating’ people.”</p>

<p>“But your papers are full of personal abuse. Do you think <em>that</em>
an advantage?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly; but it is unquestionably a great help—a seasoning of
dull editorials. Our people have so much ordinary conversation in the
course of the day, that, if it were not for the slander contained in
our newspapers, they would not be amused at all. <em>Papers</em>, sir,
are ‘the eating, drink, and fuel’ of the Americans; and on that account
they can never be too hot for them.”</p>

<p>“But very high seasoning marks a bad taste; I should think the best
papers on what is called ‘the aristocratic side’ would scorn personal
abuse.”</p>

<p>“Quite the reverse, sir, I assure you. It’s the only means of
attracting notoriety, and of pleasing our first people. Besides,
it would be useless to play the part of a gentleman in <em>that
respect</em>, when all the rest are blackguards. We want strength, sir!
strength! and nothing but strength!—none of your ‘milk and molasses’
productions, of which a man can make neither head nor tail. If we give
a man a beating, we do not want him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> to get up again; ‘we go the whole
hog.’ When we attack a man, we assail at once his moral, political,
religious, and domestic relations. Every little helps, you know. ‘Give
a dog a bad name, and hang him!’ says the proverb, and it is just so
with our politicians.”</p>

<p>By this time I began to be afraid of the man, lest, if he should not
“steal my purse,” he might publish me in the papers. He looked, indeed,
like a desperate fellow; though his self-sufficiency was quite amusing,
and the smacking of his lips and the stroking of his chin, with which
he accompanied every one of his sayings, were sufficiently ludicrous to
destroy the effect of the ferocious manner in which he paced the room.
I therefore made no farther reply, but began to dress for supper. This
untimely cessation of conversation seemed to annoy him, as it probably
prevented him from showing off, and impressing me with a proper respect
for his station. He therefore drew a parcel of papers from his pocket,
and throwing them violently on the table—</p>

<p>“Here,” exclaimed he, “is the last news. I dare say you know it
already. We have triumphed in every part of the country. Our State is
carried ‘high and dry.’”</p>

<p>“I do not care much about politics,” replied I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t?” said he. “Why, then, do you stay in the country?”</p>

<p>“Cannot you imagine a man to have any other business but politics?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, sir! a man may be a merchant, a doctor, or a tradesman;
but, I mean, how do you <em>amuse</em> yourself? I for my part should
go mad if I had not politics to divert myself.” (With pride,) “I
<em>need</em> not be a politician, thank God! I have money enough without
it; but I <em>love</em> politics on account of the pleasure they give me.
I glory in them! There is such fun in being on the side that beats. One
hundred and fifty guns, sir, are to be fired from Albany to New York,
and from New York back again to Albany, in honour of our last victory.
Where is the pleasure to be compared to that, sir? To carry a whole
State ‘smack, smooth, and no mistake!’”</p>

<p>“But it must be very annoying to be beaten.”</p>

<p>“That never occurs to me, sir. I never stay long with the beaten party.
If you study our politics, you will always find that our most ‘talented
men’ desert a party just before it is going to break up. We always like
to be on the conquering side. That’s the way to ‘get along’ in this
country, sir, if you want to be a politician. But is there no bell in
this room?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> I’ll see how long it will take <em>to raise a waiter</em>.”</p>

<p>“What do you want, sir?” grinned a negro almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>“Some brandy and water and half-a-dozen cigars: I am going to write an
article.”</p>

<p>“Then I do not wish to disturb you,” said I, grateful for an
opportunity of escaping from the room.</p>

<p>Scarcely was I half an hour down in the reading-room before a huge bell
rang for supper. I expected, as usual, a rush into the dining-hall;
but was much surprised in perceiving the quiet gentlemanly manner in
which every one took his seat. The supper was excellent, and, what is
more, it was well served. I began to perceive that I had fallen into
good hands, and was only sorry that an establishment in every respect
so unexceptionable should have adopted the vexatious custom of having
the roll of travellers called by the bar-keeper, in the manner of some
surly sergeant, before accommodating them with a room. A great deal of
unpleasant feeling arises from mere mistakes in forms, which may easily
be corrected by a little attention to the usages of the world, and
which, therefore, cannot be sufficiently recommended to innkeepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Early the next morning I found myself safely seated in one of the huge
railroad cars which leave Baltimore every morning for Washington. This
railroad, I believe, is one of the worst in the United States; the
travelling on it being excessively tedious, the stoppages frequent,
and the rate very slow. I believe we did not go faster than seven or
eight miles an hour, so that we required nearly half a day to complete
a journey of about forty English miles. Nothing can be more barren than
the country through which the railroad is laid; and the approach to the
metropolis is anything but striking, although the entrance is by the
way of the Capitol.</p>

<p>Washington is, indeed, a city <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, of which no European
who has not actually seen it can form an adequate idea. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Serullier,
formerly minister of France, used to call it “a city of magnificent
distances;” but, though this be true, I should rather call it “a city
without streets.” The Capitol, a magnificent palace, situated on an
eminence called Capitol-hill, and the White-house, the dwelling of the
President, are the only two specimens of architecture in the whole
town; the rest being mere hovels, and even the public buildings,
such as the Treasury, War and Navy Departments, and the General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Post-office, little superior to the most ordinary dwelling-houses in
Europe. The whole town is, in fact, but an appendix to those two public
buildings, a sort of ante-chamber either to the Capitol or to the house
of the chief magistrate. If such a town were situated in Europe, one
would imagine those buildings to be the residences of princes, and the
rest the humble dwellings of their dependants.</p>

<p>The only thing that approaches a street in Washington is Pennsylvania
Avenue, a sometimes single, sometimes double row of houses,
leading from the Capitol to the White-house. In this street are
the two principal hotels of the city, and a considerable number of
boarding-houses. The former are two large barracks, capable of holding
each from one hundred and fifty to two hundred people; the latter are,
for the most part, mean insignificant-looking dens, in which a man
finds the worst accommodations at the most exorbitant prices, and must
often be glad to be accommodated at all.</p>

<p>The most aristocratic inn in Washington is Gadsby’s, though I consider
this “to be a mere matter of taste;” the pretensions to aristocracy
resting on four clean walls, and a triple row of galleries in the
court, which render the distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span> of the rooms convenient, and the
rooms themselves agreeable and airy. In every other respect I found no
difference between Gadsby’s and Brown’s, or even Fuller’s, which is
further up towards the President’s house; and, in comparison to other
first-rate hotels in the United States, the fare and accommodations in
all of them are altogether beneath mediocrity. Gadsby, by the by, keeps
an excellent assortment of wines, and he is himself a very gentlemanly
and agreeable man.</p>

<p>Among the boarding-houses there is, I believe, a good deal of
aristocratic classification, owing to the different sets of senators
and representatives who establish their clubs in them. Some also there
are whose pretensions to gentility are principally founded on the
landladies being descended from some ancient family, or on their being
related to some distinguished members of Congress. In short, every
boarding-house marks a particular shade of aristocracy; the Southern
(those for Southern members) being the most refined, and each of them,
in spite of the bad living, the focus of a particular coterie.</p>

<p>There is also a hotel in Pennsylvania Avenue, called “The
<span class="smcap">Native</span> American;” probably for the accommodation of such
members of Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> and their friends as think themselves entitled
to worse fare than can be obtained at other places, for having the
aristocratic preference of birth—no matter where, and of whom, in
the United States,—over every unfortunate stranger <em>directly</em>
descended from Europe. I am not disposed to quarrel with any American
for <em>enjoying his birth</em>; though I cannot but think that the
American Indians are much more entitled to be called “Native Americans”
than any descendant from an English, Scotch, Irish, German, French,
Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, or Portuguese family that happens to be born
in the Union.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me in Washington was the unusual number of
persons perambulating the streets without any apparent occupation, of
which every other American city, with the exception of Philadelphia,
seems to be entirely drained. If there be poor and idle persons walking
the streets of New York, Boston, or Baltimore, it is, I am sorry to
say, generally owing to some late arrival from Europe,—some of the
steerage passengers being yet left without employment. Washington,
however, is a city of <em>American</em> idlers,—a set of gentlemen of
such peculiar merit as well to deserve a public comment. They live in
what is called “elegant style,” rise in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> morning at eight or nine,
have breakfast in their own rooms, then smoke five or six cigars until
twelve, at which time they dress for the Senate; few gentlemen ever
honouring the <em>House of Representatives</em> with their presence,
except just before leaving the Capitol.</p>

<p>The Senate of the United States is, indeed, the finest drawing-room
in Washington; for it is there the young women of fashion resort for
the purpose of exhibiting their attractions. The Capitol is, in point
of fashion, the opera-house of the city; the House of Representatives
being the crush-room. In the absence of a decent theatre, the Capitol
furnishes a tolerable place of rendezvous, and is on that account
frequented during the whole season—from December until April or
May—by every lounger in the place, and by every <i>belle</i> that
wishes to become the fashion.</p>

<p>After speaking and talking is over in the Senate, the idlers commence
the regular performance of eating, which is no sort of amusement to
any one in America who is obliged to dine at an ordinary. For this
reason they club together in numbers from four to six, to dine at their
rooms; single dinners being too expensive, and the people who have the
means of entertaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> in Washington being not sufficiently numerous to
secure every dandy a place at a private gentleman’s table.</p>

<p>The routs in Washington, in spite of the small rooms and the economy
of refreshments, are delightful, lasting generally from nine in the
evening until two in the morning; after which the <i lang="fr">élégants</i>,
wholly exhausted from the uncommon exertion of being agreeable four or
five hours in succession, repair to some cellar or beef-shop, not quite
so well furnished as the common resorts of cabmen and omnibus drivers
in London, but which the aristocratic taste of the young men elevates
into “refectories.”</p>

<p>It is in these cellars that a stranger may become acquainted with “real
life in Washington.” In the best part of the season, when speeches are
plenty and cash flush, the idlers’ “refectories” keep open the whole
night; the regular eating and drinking, and, as I was informed, also
the <em>gambling</em>, never commencing until twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>One of these establishments,—the best of the kind I believe in the
metropolis,—“the Epicure House,” as it is termed, was recommended to
me as doing canvass-back ducks in the neatest style, and being always
the resort of the most fashionable company. This recommendation,
joined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> the fact that nothing can be obtained at an inn after the
hour of eleven,—a practice which adds much to the convenience of the
<em>innkeepers</em>,—induced me to try the skill of a coloured cook, and
to have a peep at the young men that were called “the first” in the
law-giving city.</p>

<p>On inquiring the way, I was pointed to a house forming the corner
opposite to Gadsby’s hotel, to which was attached a lamp which gave
exactly as much light as was necessary in order not to break one’s
neck in descending the staircase which led to the entrance, but
left the establishment itself in precisely that sort of obscurity
which is always desirable for a place serving as a rendezvous for
<i lang="fr">comme-il-faut</i> people. On entering it,—it being only a little
after eleven,—I found the room, which was divided into boxes after the
manner of a common English eating-house, nearly empty; a few persons
only eating scolloped oysters or drinking punch, but a number of black
imps slinking about in evident expectation of better business. I
hesitated at first whether I should take a seat, the appearance of the
table-cloths, cruets, &amp;c. being far from inviting; though the bar was
stocked with bottles bearing the inscriptions—“Sillery champaign,”
“Klause Johannisberger,” “Marcobrunner,” “Hermitage,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>The bar-keeper, perceiving my want of resolution, came forward, and
accosted me in the most polite terms.</p>

<p>“You wish, perhaps, for a private room, sir? If you do not want it
longer than after midnight, I can give you the one adjoining. At twelve
I expect a party who may want it until three or four in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I do not like to take possession of a room which I am
obliged to give up in three quarters of an hour. Have you none other?”</p>

<p>“I have yet another room up stairs; but it is occupied by a
dinner-party, which is not likely to break up till two or three in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“You keep very late hours, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, we commence late. If you stop here till two o’clock, you
will see this room crowded. This evening all the gentlemen are at Mrs.
***’s, who gives nothing but tea and cakes; which, as you may imagine,
is not precisely the thing for young men that are dancing the whole
evening. Many of them are yet <em>growing</em>, and, as is usually the
case with such gentlemen, have an excellent appetite.”</p>

<p>“And so they come here to sup?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“They do me that honour, sir; and I do my best to accommodate them.”</p>

<p>(What a polite publican, thought I, if he were not a mulatto!) “And
what have you fit to eat?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Fine canvass-back ducks, oysters, and venison. Canvass-back ducks are
prime; just the season. Shall I show you into the other room?”</p>

<p>“No, I would rather take a duck here; but you must give me a clean
table-cloth.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. What sort of wine will you take? hock, champaign,
claret, madeira, or sherry? I have got some first-rate Johannisberger
and some of Lynch’s claret.”</p>

<p>“Have you champaign in pint bottles?”</p>

<p>“At your service, sir.—John! put a clean table-cloth at No. 3. Do you
want the papers in the mean while?”</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes one of the best specimens of that
inestimable bird, the canvass-back duck, for which the Americans might
justly be envied by European princes, was placed before me, “with the
usual trimmings,” consisting of jelly, butter, beets, and pickles,
together with a small bottle of the Napoleon brand champaign. The whole
was served in good order; and I could not but wonder that in a place
of so mean and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> unfashionable an appearance a person should find such
excellent accommodations. What would <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Stuart have said if his good
fortune had led him to the Epicure House in Washington? I can assure
him that in no other place in the United States could he have eaten
canvass-back ducks more deserving of praise and comment.</p>

<p>Hardly had I commenced eating, before a noisy uproarious set of
men entered the premises, singing and swaggering, and calling in a
stentorian voice for cheese and <em>crackers</em>.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>“What a d—d shabby party that was!” exclaimed a young man, dressed in
the latest New York fashion, with dirty gloves, and his shirt-collar
turned down with perspiration; “one of your regular <em>Boston</em>
ones.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I believe nothing was handed round but lemonade and
spunge-cake, and of that there was scarcely enough for the ladies.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not go up stairs?” cried another; “there were plenty of
sandwiches, besides a large basin of toddy.”</p>

<p>“How could he have found time for that; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> was all attention to Miss
***; were you not, John?” ejaculated a little creature dressed in boots.</p>

<p>“Ah! are you here?” cried John; “we lost you at the door; how did you
get here?”</p>

<p>“On my legs,” replied the little fellow. “Did you expect me to pay
two dollars to one of those rascally niggers for the pleasure of a
<em>ride</em>?”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“But did you wear boots at the ball?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; I took them off in the entry, and put them on again as
I came out. I always carry my shoes in my pocket when I go to a party.”</p>

<p>“That’s regular Boston fashion!” shouted the company. “How much do you
make by it a year?”</p>

<p>“I <em>save</em> by it more than a hundred dollars; and ‘a dollar saved
is a dollar earned,’ says Franklin.”</p>

<p>“But what do you do with your boots at the party?”</p>

<p>“I <em>hide</em> them as well as I can; I have only lost one pair in
Boston. They were taken away by mistake; but I advertised them in the
papers, and got them back again. But I say, John!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> how do you stand
with Miss ***? All right, hem?”</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake, don’t bother me now!” cried John; “I am too dry to
talk.” (Turning to a bronze-faced mulatto boy, “Why, you cursed little
imp, cannot you bring me the whisky punch I ordered?”) “To dance a
cotillon lasting three hours! Those girls’ feet don’t seem ever to get
tired.”</p>

<p>“And a German cotillon, too,” rejoined a tall gentlemanly figure, who
appeared to be a Southerner; “if it had not been for the mazurka, which
some of our ladies still object to, because there is too much whirling
and dancing on the heels in it, I should not have had a moment’s rest.
I wonder how the women can stand it!”</p>

<p>“And then the <i>gallopade</i>! why, that alone wears out a pair of
shoes,” cried the Bostonian; “the mazurka only requires <i>heeling</i>.”</p>

<p>“They ought to make you president of the savings’ bank!” observed the
Southerner.</p>

<p>“That is,” said John, “if he understands saving other people’s money as
well as his own.”</p>

<p>By this time the waiter returned with the punch, a huge lump of cheese,
and a basket of biscuits, which was immediately seized upon and
devoured, as if the persons present were the half-starved crew of some
American whaler just returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span> from a three years’ cruise round Cape
Horn.</p>

<p>“I say, Jim,” said John, “did you taste the wine?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Jim; “but I could not swallow it. It was not worth
three dollars a dozen.”</p>

<p>“I believe it was Sicily madeira.”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows <em>what</em> sort of madeira it was; I took to the toddy.</p>

<p>“If these ladies had not kept me going, I should have done so too.”</p>

<p>“That’s the pleasure of courting,” said Jim tauntingly.</p>

<p>“Why, a man has to come to it some time or other,” said John.</p>

<p>“Miss *** is certainly a pretty girl; but, if I were in your place, I
should not like her flirting in Washington. Washington is the worst
place for a young lady in the United States. It is altogether too
European.”</p>

<p>“I do not like it myself,” observed the Southerner; “nor the custom of
our fashionable women to bring their daughters here just as they have
left the boarding-school, in order to introduce them to the <i lang="fr">beau
monde</i>.”</p>

<p>“And to teach them the gallopade and the mazurka, which is setting a
premium on <em>foreigners</em>,” said John with some bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be angry,” cried Jim. “You don’t expect to be cut out by a
German or a Pole, do you?”</p>

<p>“You may go to —— with your insinuation,” cried John: “what I
object to in the society of Washington is, that it teaches women to
<em>amuse</em> themselves; or, rather, that it obliges <em>us</em> to amuse
<em>them</em>.”</p>

<p>“That is rather bad,” interrupted a thin pale-looking gentleman
with spectacles; “as it must necessarily interfere with our serious
pursuits.”</p>

<p>“Such as drinking punch, and playing cards,” observed the Southerner.</p>

<p>“I mean <em>literary</em> pursuits,” said the man with spectacles.</p>

<p>“Oh yes! we forgot that. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** writes the <i>on dits</i> for the New
York ***; of course he has no time to throw away upon women. ‘Time is
money,’ says Franklin.—I say, George, did you win or lose at whist?”</p>

<p>“I won twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Then you neither lost your time nor your money.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, George must pay the punch,” shouted the company.</p>

<p>“George is going to do no such thing,” replied the littérateur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“Then let us toss up for it,” proposed Jim.</p>

<p>“That would not do,” objected John; “he, as a Yankee, would have the
advantage in <em>guessing</em>.”</p>

<p>“I think it best,” said George, “for every man to pay his own
reckoning.” So saying, he called the waiter, paid for his punch, and,
without uttering another syllable, left the party to settle their
accounts after their own manner.</p>

<p>“What a selfish, unsociable, stingy fellow that is,” cried Jim; “would
not even toss up for it! and yet—would you believe it?—he is engaged
to one of the prettiest girls in New England.”</p>

<p>“She probably marries him for his literary reputation. Boston women are
sometimes in love with that!” said John. “But let us now toss up for
the reckoning.”</p>

<p>“It’s all paid,” observed the waiter, pointing to the Southerner.</p>

<p>“Just like him; always throwing away his money!” muttered John,
pocketing his piece. Jim made a bow, and swore he would be revenged:
but all finally agreed to go home, visibly contented.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they left, before a large party of about fifteen or twenty
young men, among whom there appeared to be some Europeans, entered
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span> room, swearing that they had been done out of a regular meal,
and that they were now going to make up for it. “Let us have three or
four canvass-back ducks, and some of Lynch’s claret,” cried one of
them; “the devil take the stuff they call toddy! I had as lief swallow
prussic acid,—it has given me the cramp in my stomach.”</p>

<p>“If you had drunk it here,” grinned the waiter, “you would feel all the
better for it; we make that article first-rate.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” cried the gentleman, “and do as you are bid.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir!” said the negro, and went to speak to the cook.</p>

<p>“Can we go into the other room?” demanded one of the party.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen are dining there,” replied the bar-keeper.</p>

<p>“Gambling you mean, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“It’s no business of mine to inquire <em>what</em> they are doing; they
have been there ever since dinner.”</p>

<p>“Then they must leave soon, and we may have the room.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will,” rejoined the bar-keeper. “Whenever they come
to dine, they generally stay for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“And the room adjoining?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Is already engaged. I expect the gentlemen every minute.”</p>

<p>The party cast an inquiring look at one another, and then gathered
round a small table as well as they could, quietly awaiting the arrival
of the supper.</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes from this time, it being nearly twelve
o’clock, the whole room was filled to overflowing with the most motley
assemblage of persons I ever beheld in my life. It was a group worthy
of being preserved on canvass. Besides the party already mentioned,
there were gathered round the chimney a parcel of Kentuckians, a giant
race of men, full of strange oaths and tobacco-juice, discussing
politics, and betting heavily on the issue of certain matters then
under debate. Their language, surely, was not altogether intelligible
to me; but what I <em>did</em> understand convinced me that they are
justly reputed for their wit and humour. One of them—standing, I
should judge, six feet two—was a good-natured punster, who, in spite
of the serious turn their conversation had taken, kept the company in a
continual roar of laughter.</p>

<p>Round the bar was stationed a more noisy and less original set of men;
such as a person might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> see in any of the larger gin-shops of London
on a Saturday evening. They were vulgar and “uproarious,” smoked bad
cigars and spit promiscuously round the room, while the Kentuckians
showed their better breeding by always hitting the same spot. A third
party, evidently composed of <em>young bucks</em>, dressed in the latest
London fashions, with perfumed hair and real French kid gloves, were
discussing the merits of women; which they did <i>con amore</i>, using
all the English slang they had collected from the newspapers, or from
fashionable novels, and taking great pains to appear as outlandish as
possible. The intervals between these clusters were filled up with
single gentlemen, of all ages and descriptions, and in every possible
state of consciousness,—from that of a perfect knowledge of “the
thousand natural shocks this flesh is heir to,” to that of the most
total oblivion, and triumph “o’er a’ the ills o’ life.”</p>

<p>What gave a peculiar character to this little pandemonium was the
continual apparition and vanishing of the black, brown, and yellow
waiters; all shining with perspiration, and leaving, as they passed,
something not altogether unlike the odour of brimstone behind them.
These exhalations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> the steam of the viands, the smell of rum, brandy,
and tobacco, independent of the corrupt, sultry air produced by the
presence of a large number of persons in a small room, soon obliged me
to quit the scene of merriment; and, in half an hour later, I found
myself safely in bed at Gadsby’s.</p>

<i>King Richard III.</i> Act iii. Scene 5.<br>
</p>


<p>The next day I looked over my letters of introduction, which, being
principally addressed to members of the cabinet and the <i lang="fr">corps
diplomatique</i>, I determined to deliver in person. The influence of
the diplomatic agents in Washington on the moral and social habits
of the people, is much greater than their effect on the politics of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span> State; the executive power of the President and Council being
not only limited by the Senate, but also indirectly by the House of
Representatives, and the manifestation of public opinion at the annual
elections. A minister in Washington is, with regard to his diplomatic
agency, pretty much confined to official acts, such as may at any
time be made public: his influence with a particular member of the
cabinet, or with the President himself,—his success with a particular
coterie,—his intrigues against any person that may have rendered
himself obnoxious to his government, are of little or no avail at the
Congress, with which, as yet, no foreign diplomatist has attempted a
political relation. But, in point of fashion, their power is unlimited;
their decisions being quoted as oracles, and their manners made the
standard of society. In Washington, no party is considered fashionable
unless graced by some distinguished senator, and a few members of the
<i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i>. Between the latter and the senators exists
yet this relation, that every senator has a right to introduce a
gentleman to a foreign minister, either personally, or by leaving his
card together with that of his friend; a privilege which is denied to
the more vulgar members of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>As far as I was able to ascertain the influence of foreign residents in
Washington, it was confined, with the representative of the greatest
power in Christendom, to setting the example of genuine hospitality
in the shape of the most prosperous dinner parties given in the
metropolis,—his <i lang="fr">attachés</i> I believe, went <i>fox</i>-hunting
in the outskirts of the city; with the representative of the land of
chivalry and tigers, to setting the example of taste in the shape
of regular <i lang="fr">soirées musicales</i>; in the clever and witty envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of a northern power, to
introducing the fashion of dancing <em>on the heels</em>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>—which, by
the by, was a pretty little manœuvre on the part of the old gentleman,
who had long ago lost the use of his <em>toes</em> by the gout; in the
representative of a literary court, to the privilege of spouting
literature and science to a <em>sober</em> audience, &amp;c. The ministers
of the Italian courts, who had the longest string of titles printed on
their cards, had no distinct influence, except in setting the fashion
of eating and drinking gracefully—at another man’s table.</p>

<p>To understand the humour and good cheer which reign among the
<i lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i> in Washington, it is sufficient to know
that it consists almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> wholly of bachelors, who, according to
the <i lang="fr">étiquette</i> of the place, enjoy the privilege of inviting
<em>ladies</em> to their parties.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This is certainly an enviable
distinction; and, if anything can reconcile a man to living in single
blessedness, it is, I am sure, an ambassadorship in the American
metropolis. Yet, great as the advantages of such a situation are to the
ministers of England, Russia, and even France, they prove a source of
incessant vexation to the envoys of minor powers. I was told of several
of the ministers who lived in houses of such frail construction as
to make the ladies afraid of walking into them, much less to attempt
a dance; they said that “they regretted extremely that it was not in
their power to give parties, it being useless to send out invitations
when the ladies vowed they would not come.”</p>

<p>In what light ambassadors are held <em>by the ladies</em> will appear
from the following anecdote:—At a dinner party to which most of
the representatives of the greater powers and some of the smaller
ones were invited, one of them, a jolly old bachelor of the English
school, attempted a song, which so much gratified the ladies, that
it was proposed every gentleman present should, in turn, follow the
example. Russia and some other great powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> immediately obeyed
the summons; but when the turn came to the representative of a new
court, he indignantly exclaimed, “<i lang="fr">Mon roi ne m’a pas envoyé ici
pour chanter.</i>”—“Well,” answered a lady, “if <em>you</em> will not
sing, we shall ask your gallant king to send us somebody else who
<em>will</em>.”</p>

<p>Being made acquainted with the <i lang="fr">étiquette</i> of Washington, I
ordered a carriage, and inquired the directions of the persons on whom
I wished to call.</p>

<p>“Bless your soul, sir!” cried the landlord, “that is not at all
necessary in this city; all you have to do is to tell the name of the
person you wish to call on to the ‘driver,’ and he will carry you there
with the greatest possible speed.”</p>

<p>“That may be with regard to the President’s house and the residences of
foreign ministers; but I have also letters to some of the senators, and
even representatives of Congress.”</p>

<p>“That don’t signify,” rejoined the landlord. “These black fellows not
only know the residences of every senator and distinguished member of
Congress, but also those of the higher public officers, clerks, editors
of newspapers, &amp;c. Once under the care of a black ‘driver,’ it is quite
needless for you to know the direction of a single gentleman in this
city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>With this piece of information I “embarked,” as the Americans say,
“on board of a Washington hack,”—the usual means of conveyance
for gentlemen; and in a short time found myself <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
with the editor of one of the first papers. I found him a plain
unassuming gentleman, though he enjoyed the reputation of being a man
of extraordinary talents. He regretted that he could not be of more
service to me during my short stay in the city; but, notwithstanding,
promised to introduce me personally to some of the most distinguished
senators of his party. “I have nothing to do with the rest,” added
he; “but I dare say you have letters to some of them, and one will
cheerfully introduce you to all the others.” He then unceremoniously
excused himself with pressing business, invited me to dine with him
<i lang="fr">sans cérémonie</i> on the Sunday following, in company with a select
number of <em>his party</em>, and almost bowed me out of the room.</p>

<p>“A singular character!” said I to myself, as I again stepped into my
carriage and ordered the coachman to proceed to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury, the
secretary of the Treasury. “I have, after all, done wrong to omit the
<i>De</i>.”</p>

<p>I was so fortunate as to find <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury at home, and was at once
ushered into the parlour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> I found him surrounded by his family,
equally distinguished for beauty and accomplishments. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury is
a gentleman very nearly, or quite, fifty years of age, of agreeable
address and kind manners; though, probably owing to his being born
and brought up in New England, a little ceremonious. It has been the
fashion in America for the last eight or ten years to decry “the
secretary of the Treasury,” and to impeach even his honesty; as if the
money withdrawn from the United States’ bank had filled his coffers and
those of the President.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury is a man of great tact for business, and of the most
indefatigable application; but the style of his official documents is
often laborious and cumbrous, with an occasional attempt at laconism,
which renders the fault still more apparent. But, notwithstanding
this imperfection, his annual reports contain a vast deal of
information, and the most minute statistical details of the progress
of agriculture, manufacture, and commerce, not only of America, but of
every other country. To judge fairly and impartially of the ability
of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury as a head of department, it is necessary to consider
that every question which has agitated the country ever since the
elevation of General Jackson, has turned on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span> subject of finance,
and that therefore the secretary of the Treasury was placed in the most
difficult and conspicuous position of any public man in the United
States, the President himself scarcely excepted.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury has been represented, not only in America, but also in
England, as a cunning politician and popularity-hunter. This reproach,
as far as I have been able to judge,—and I believe I have had as good
an opportunity of observing <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury, and the course of public
events, as any one who has felt himself called upon to publish his
lucubrations to the world,—is altogether malicious and groundless.
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury owes his elevation to his firmness of character and his
sincere attachment to republican institutions. So far from courting
public favour, he is but too frequently wanting in those trifling
attentions and nice observances which insure popularity. I ought yet to
observe that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury has a taste for letters, which he manifests
in the best possible manner, by being kind to those who have more
leisure than he to cultivate them. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Willis,—the same that dined
at the Duke of Gordon’s,—<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> L***, and a number of minor stars, are
indebted to his kind hospitality; and I myself can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> testify to his
condescension even to ordinary men.</p>

<p>What I have said on the subject of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Woodbury’s popularity naturally
induces me to say a few words on the peculiar character of American
politicians. The question proposed by a member of that body is
generally this:—“What measure can we carry to defeat our antagonists?”
neither party appearing to have any fixed political tenets further
than refer to the public revenue, which is a home question with every
man and every party. On this account we often see in the United States
the Democratic party assume the very principles they once denounced
in the Federalists; and, on the other hand, the Federalists profess
the doctrines which they most abhorred in the Democrats. The fact is,
very few senators, representatives, and men in office have a clear
understanding of the vast importance of the principles they maintain;
nor do they seem to have a correct notion of republicanism, <em>as
contrasted with other forms of government</em>. But then, how many
of them possess an adequate knowledge of history—even of their own
country? They all have, indeed, a certain republican instinct, or what
the Americans call a correct <em>feeling</em>, of what is compatible with
the text of their constitution; but not many of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> I believe, take
a philosophical view of their government, such as would enable them
to reduce the whole to a <em>system</em>, and to perceive accurately
the bearing of every new question on the principles laid down in the
national charter. Nor would such a metaphysical knowledge of the
constitution materially benefit a partisan leader, who never asks
what is right or wrong in the abstract, but merely “What do <em>my
constituents</em> consider as right or wrong? What is the opinion of
the public on this subject?” When a new question is proposed, he
thrusts out his <em>feelers</em>, to feel the public pulse; and, having
ascertained that, he makes his speeches accordingly, in order that the
people may see that he is actively engaged on their side; for on the
side that beats he <em>must</em> be, or he is “a ruined man.”</p>

<p>This sort of moral cowardice, which more or less pervades all classes
of society, and of which the example is set in Congress, is certainly
one of the worst features of American politics; and would almost make
a man doubt the beneficial influence of republican institutions on the
developement of mind and character, if their numerous blessings in
other respects did not prove them capable of insuring the happiness of
a people.</p>

<p>When I thus speak of American politicians, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> do not mean to draw
envious comparisons between them and European statesmen. I belong
neither to that class of Europeans that cannot pronounce the name
of America without a grudge, nor to that class of fashionable and
travelled Americans that cannot find anything in their own country
equal to Europe. On the contrary, I maintain that there is quite as
much intelligence, application, and certainly of virtue, in the members
of the cabinet at Washington, as can be found in the ministerial
council of any European prince. And I say this, fully aware of its
producing more sneers among the higher classes in America than in
Europe.</p>

<p>If the conduct of every European minister were inquired into, like
that of a head of department in Washington,—if his private and
public transactions were canvassed with the same unrelenting severity
as in America,—if he had to account for every one of his acts, not
merely to Parliament, or, in course of time, to a limited number
of electors, but to the people at large, speaking annually through
the ballot-boxes,—then, I am afraid, few would be found capable of
sustaining their position for a single year.</p>

<p>An American statesman has the most difficult position of any one in
the world, for he has to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span> solve a great and intricate problem in the
presence of a multitude of spectators, who are never to see that he
is puzzled, and who never have the patience to wait for the end, but
condemn a measure from the first moment its immediate results do not
answer their expectations. For this reason few men in America, even if
they possess the talent, have the <em>courage</em> to propose a radical
reform of abuses, or to work some signal good, unless the execution of
it is sure to be <em>step by step</em> applauded by large majorities.
It is this courting of popularity which is the bane of even the best
statesmen in the United States; but it is in part forced upon them,—it
is the <i lang="la">conditio sine quâ non</i> of their usefulness.</p>

<p>From the secretary of the Treasury I drove to the lodgings of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Henry
Clay, the celebrated senator from Kentucky. I found this extraordinary
man, who was then already a little past his prime, the very type of
what passes in Europe, ever since the clever caricatures of Mrs.
Trollope, as “an American character.” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Clay stands upwards of six
feet; has a semi-Indian, half-human half-savage countenance, in which,
however, the intellectual strongly preponderates over the animal. His
manners, at first sight, appear to be extremely vulgar; and yet he is
graceful, and even dignified,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> in his intercourse with strangers.
He chews tobacco, drinks whisky punch, gambles, puts his legs on the
table or the chimney, and spits, as an American would say, “like a
regular Kentucky hog-driver;” and yet he is all gentleness, politeness,
and cordiality in the society of ladies. Add to this that his organs
of speech are the most melodious; and that, with great imagination
and humour, he combines manly eloquence, and the power of sarcasm in
the most extraordinary degree; and it will easily be conceived why
he should have been able to captivate high and low,—<i lang="fr">l’homme du
salon</i>, and the “squatter” in the Western wilderness.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img002">
<img src="images/002.jpg" class="w50"  alt="HENRY CLAY.">
</span></p>
<p class="center caption">HENRY CLAY.<br></p>

<p class="p2">Much as <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Clay is esteemed in America, I do not think the people
have as yet done justice to his talents. These, to be sure, are, owing
to his advanced age, on the decline; but even the <em>remnants</em> of
a mind like Clay’s are great, and entitle him to be ranked among the
greatest living statesmen. He was for a long time the advocate of
the system of internal improvements, combated with so much success
by General Jackson. He advocated successively the establishment of
national roads and canals, the continuance of a United States’ bank,
the tariff, and, in short, every measure conducive to centralization.
That this system, while it strengthens the government, and introduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
order and uniformity into the administration of the country,
diminishes, at the same time, the liberties of the individual States,
and, in general, ill agrees with the principles of a pure democracy,
such as are laid down in the American constitution, no one, who is not
himself interested in the question, can reasonably deny; but it would
be equally absurd to suppose every man who is an advocate of a central
measure, to be at once an enemy to republican institutions, and a
traitor to his country.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Clay advocated every measure he proposed, not as a mere partisan,
but as a statesman who clearly saw its first and ultimate bearings on
national politics. His is a mind of vast conceptions, which, if it
had not at one time speculated too much in elections,—I allude to
the trick he played at the election of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> John Quincy Adams,—might
have long ago enabled him to fill the station to which his unfortunate
ambition a little too early aspired.</p>

<p>From <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Clay I called upon <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Thomas H. Benton, the democratic
senator from Missouri. This gentleman is altogether in a false
position; for he is, in my opinion, as much over-rated by his friends
as he is under-rated by his enemies. I was the bearer of a letter to
him by one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> most intimate friends, and a person of high standing
and much influence in the country; and yet the reception I met with
was cold and ceremonious,—his manners forced, and almost ludicrously
dignified. The truth is, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton behaves on most occasions like a
man who has not yet found his level in society; being continually on
his guard lest he might not be done justice to, and afraid lest his
unrestrained familiar manners might derogate from the estimation in
which he is held by the public. The first impression that he makes
upon a stranger I should judge to be decidedly unfavourable, though he
greatly improves upon acquaintance, and, as he drops his dignity, shows
his truly estimable points of character. As <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton’s democracy
is probably proof against the seductions of Europe,—a thing I would
not assert of one American out of ten,—I would recommend to him a
trip to Paris,—not to London,—in order that he might learn to carry
himself with a little more ease. It would vastly improve his manners
and general appearance, and perhaps make him find favour even with
<em>female</em> philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton is perhaps the most unfortunate speaker in the Senate; not,
indeed, as regards the substance of his discourses, most of which are
clever and full of information; but with regard to his disjointed,
broken, sometimes loud, and again sometimes scarcely audible,
delivery. This is undoubtedly the reason why his speeches are so much
under-rated, though they contain more solid matter of statistics and
history than can be found in the perhaps more eloquent efforts of his
colleagues. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton is a most uncommonly laborious man, and is
constantly collecting facts, not only in America but also in Europe,
in support of his political doctrines; though his partiality for
France, and his eternal and irksome comparisons between the republic
under the consulate of Bonaparte and the confederation of the United
States, rather injure than establish his theories with a considerable
portion of the American public. Another fault with which <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton has
been reproached consists in his indelicate allusions to his personal
prowess. Every one knows that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton is as brave as Cæsar; but
it is not necessary that he himself should refer to it. An appeal to
arms in a deliberative assembly is always vulgar, if not absolutely
savage; and ought to be avoided in the most studious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> manner, not only
by every man of religion and principle, but also by every gentleman
of good taste. There is, as yet, too much bullyism in the legislative
assemblies of America; many worthy representatives forgetting that it
is easier to fight for, than to establish by argument, the correctness
of a political principle. On the whole, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Benton is a clever
politician, an industrious collector of statistics, and, with the
exception of his delivery, a most skilful debater in Congress. He has,
during a certain period, been almost the only and valiant defender of
General Jackson’s policy in the Senate; and has, by his perseverance,
honesty, and good faith, become universally popular among the labouring
classes, whose interests he has during his whole life constantly and
successfully advocated.</p>

<p>My next visit was to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Salis Wright, senator from the State of New
York, the avowed democratic champion of that State, and indeed a man of
the most extraordinary talents. He is one of those men whose urbanity
and frankness the Americans indicate by saying, “he has not a bit of
starch in him.” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Wright is a statesman, not a mere politician;
and will, if his talents be properly placed before the public, play
an important part in the history of his country. He and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> Calhoun
are almost the only two senators free from the “Congressional” sin
of making everlasting speeches. He is always concise, rigorously
logical, and, what is very rare in an American politician, singularly
free from personal abuse. His mind is of that rigid composition
which does not allow him to depart, for one instant, from the point
under consideration; and hence, instead of indulging himself in
irrelevant rhapsodies, sneers, and side-thrusts at the character of his
antagonists, he confines himself strictly to his argument; a method
which, if it were imitated by every senator, would enable them to
transact the same business in about the one-seventh part of the time
now needed, saving annually a sum of not less than a million of dollars.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Wright’s delivery is rapid, but distinct; proving that every
thought is digested and arranged, and flowing from a well-stored mind.
In his private life he is not a fashionable, but a plain, unassuming,
modest gentleman; who, notwithstanding his own brevity, possesses that
most extraordinary talent of powerful minds—of listening patiently
to the tedious prosings of others. I saw him, in his own room, listen
to an endless recital of an Indian campaign given by an officer in
the army, without even once heaving a sigh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span> though the thermometer
ranged at 96°; his room being one of the closest in the whole city of
Washington. At last, having listened to the hero for more than an hour,
he told him patiently that he found his story exceedingly entertaining;
but, having a few words to say to one of his friends waiting in the
parlour, he should be obliged to leave him for a few moments, in order
to afterwards hear the conclusion of so interesting a narrative. I must
yet observe that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Wright is seldom seen at the crack parties in
Washington, and is, therefore, not in the way of being much noticed by
foreign tourists.</p>

<p>My next call was on my old acquaintance, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Buchanan, senator from
Pennsylvania. This is a gentleman of plain common sense, agreeable and
dignified manners, and the most resolved unchangeable disposition. As
a speaker, he does not attempt to soar on the wings of genius; but
his arguments being always founded on experience and practical good
sense, and his unimpeachable honesty being proverbial, he is always
sure of producing effect. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Buchanan never had the character of an
office-seeker, though he has always been one of the most strenuous
defenders of General Jackson’s policy; and is even now rarely seen at
the White-house or the levees of the cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span> ministers. And yet in his
externals he is the most courtier-like senator in Congress; his dress
and manners being always what a master of ceremonies at any European
court could wish them to be in order to usher him into the presence
of his royal master. In addition to this, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Buchanan is a bachelor,
and not yet past the age at which bachelors cease to be interesting;
which accounts sufficiently for his being universally beloved, even by
those who are opposed to him in politics. Indeed, I heard it positively
asserted, more than four years ago, that he was “too much of a
gentleman,” and “had remained too long in the Senate,” to continue much
longer an advocate of democracy. This was evidently among the <i>on
dits</i>, which, as far as regards the conclusion, had not the least
foundation in it. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Buchanan is, at this moment, as sound a democrat
as ever; proving the vanity and falsehood of Cowper’s assertion, that</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">“——the age of virtuous liberty is past,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we are deep in that of cold pretence;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we too wise to trust them.”</span><br>
</p>

<p>On my return to the inn I found a numerous assemblage of gentlemen
waiting on the piazza for the ringing of the dinner-bell; which, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
Gadsby’s owing to the vast extent of the premises, is affixed to a
small steeple on the top of the house, in order that it may warn not
only the gentlemen who may be engaged in politics in their rooms, but
also those who may be lounging anywhere within a quarter of a mile
from the place of feeding. During the time the table was setting, the
dining-room itself was carefully locked, in order “to prevent impatient
people from spoiling the looks of it” before it was quite ready. While
thus in expectation of the things that were to come, I asked the
bar-keeper how many senators and representatives had taken rooms in the
house; as, from the number of gentlemen present, it was quite evident
his inn was full.</p>

<p>“Only two, sir,” replied he.</p>

<p>“And what is the reason you have so few?”</p>

<p>“Because our terms are too high; they can get board cheaper
at a boarding-house. We entertain generally but transient
people,—lobby-members; gentlemen with their families, who come here
to spend the season; now and then a letter-writer, though these are
usually stopping at Brown’s; and perhaps occasionally a spy.”</p>

<p>“And are all these men better able to pay for their board than senators
and representatives of Congress?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“Whether they be better able to pay, I know not; they seem at least
to be <em>more willing</em> to do so. If they have not got money, they
‘<em>hire</em>’ it. Washington is the <em>‘ruination’ place</em> of the
United States. Many a man comes here in tolerable circumstances, and
leaves the place as a beggar, with his money spent, and his business
neglected. So much for politics!”</p>

<p>“That’s no very flattering picture of your town.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said one of the gentlemen near me, “how many persons do you
think are solvent in this city?”</p>

<p>“I will hope a great many.”</p>

<p>“I do not think,” replied he, “there are six persons in town able to
pay their debts, if their estates were to be settled to-morrow. The
corporation itself has more debts than it can conveniently manage.
There is not a city in the Union as badly off as ours.”</p>

<p>“And then what a continual influx of paupers!” interrupted the
bar-keeper; “all coming here to seek office, to see the President, and
to avail themselves of their acquaintance with one or the other member,
to obtain a place for themselves or one of their relations. Would you
believe that people come here from a distance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> from six hundred to a
thousand miles, to hunt an appointment of six hundred dollars a year;
and that, in order to enable them to get home again, after they have
spent their last farthing, the President is often obliged to pay their
passage out of his own pocket?”</p>

<p>“I can testify to that,” said one of the gentlemen; “General Jackson
has done so more than once. When they first come here, they expect
nothing less than an appointment of two thousand dollars a year; but
by degrees their expectations become more moderate: they would then be
satisfied with a clerkship; by and by with a still more subordinate
station; and at last they would be glad if any one would pay their
bill, and enable them to get home again. I remember a most remarkable
story, which was current here shortly after the election of General
Jackson, and which is singularly characteristic of the notions of our
people as respects the power of the executive.</p>

<p>“One morning, scarcely a fortnight after the General’s arrival at
the White-house, a shabby-genteel looking man presented himself at
his parlour, and, after the usual salutation and shaking of hands,
expressed his joy at seeing the venerable old gentleman at last hold
the situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> of chief magistrate of the country, to which his
bravery, his talents, and his unimpeachable rectitude fully entitled
him. ‘We have had a hard time of it,’ said he, ‘in our little place;
but our exertions were unremitting: I myself went round to stimulate
my neighbours, and at last the victory was ours. We beat them by a
majority of ten votes, and I now behold the result of that glorious
triumph!’ The General thanked him in terms of studied politeness,
assuring him that he would resign his office in an instant if he
did not think his election gave satisfaction to a vast majority of
the people; and at last regretted his admirer’s zeal for the public
weal should have been so severely taxed on his account. ‘Oh, no
matter for that, sir!’ said he; ‘I did it with pleasure,—I did it
for myself and for my country’ (the General bowed); ‘and I now come
to congratulate you on your success’ (the General bowed again). ‘I
thought, sir,’ continued he, ‘that, as you are now President of the
United States, I might perhaps be useful to you in some official
capacity.’ (The General looked somewhat embarrassed.) ‘Pray, sir,
have you already made a choice of your cabinet ministers?’—‘I have,’
was the reply of the General.—‘Well, no matter for that; I shall
be satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> with an embassy to Europe,’—‘I am sorry to say there
is no vacancy.’—‘Then you will perhaps require a head-clerk in the
department of State?’—‘These are generally appointed by the respective
secretaries.’—‘I am very sorry for that: then I must be satisfied
with some inferior appointment.’—‘I never interfere with these: you
must address yourself to the heads of departments.’—‘But could I not
be postmaster in Washington? Only think, General, how I worked for
you!’—‘I am much obliged to you for the good opinion you entertain of
me, and for your kind offices at the last election; but the postmaster
for the city of Washington is already appointed.’—‘Well, I don’t
particularly care for that; I should be satisfied With being his
clerk.’—‘This is a subject you must mention to the postmaster.’—‘Why,
then, General,’ exclaimed the disappointed candidate for office,
‘haven’t you got an old black coat?’ You may well imagine that the
General gave him one.</p>

<p>“As extravagant as this story appears, I can assure you that there
are at any time in Washington hundreds of persons seeking employment
of some sort or other; nine-tenths of whom return home disappointed,
cursing the ingratitude of those whom they have elevated by their
suffrages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> and who are now so monstrously ungrateful as to suffer them
to gain a livelihood by common labour. All these men finish by joining
the opposition, expecting to be treated with more consideration by the
next administration.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he finished, before the bell, or rather the tocsin,
sounded for dinner. In an instant the whole company, consisting of more
than a hundred persons, were seated at table,—the dinner, including
soups and desserts, being served at once,—and in less than ten minutes
the greater portion of them began already to disperse. I had seen much
fast eating in the United States, especially on board of steam-boats;
but nothing to compare to the rapidity with which meals are despatched
in Washington. What astonished me most was, that most of the gentlemen,
very unlike those of Boston, New York, or Philadelphia, did not leave
table in order immediately to attend to business; but merely to walk or
stand on the piazza, smoke, read the papers, or talk politics.</p>

<p>Washington, as I observed before, is the only city of idlers in the
whole Union; and, for a man that is not a manufacturer or a merchant,
quite an agreeable residence. Despite of its ridiculous extent, and the
miserable and scattered situation of the dwelling-houses, it is a focus
of intellect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> and contains more resources for a man of education than
any other Transatlantic city. It is in Washington where the national
mind is formed; where local prejudices vanish under the influence of
more enlarged political views; where, if I may use the expression,
the totality of the American people absorbs the provincialism of
the different sections of the country. It is the only city in the
United States, north of the Potomac, where a man is not bored with
the everlasting talk of business,—where the <em>markets</em> are not
considered the most important topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Literary and professional men, though they are tolerated in other
American cities, and, from vanity and ostentation, occasionally shown
up, or, as a clever writer on diplomacy has it, “used by the ladies as
a pepper-box,” find their level only in Washington. Even statesmen like
Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Wright, &amp;c. are at home only listened to from
complacency, unless they touch upon a subject immediately affecting
the interest of their particular State; but, arrived in Washington,
they find themselves at once drawn into a circle of attraction, which
not only furnishes food for their minds, but, from the nature of its
composition, acts as a stimulus on their energies. Washington, in fine,
is the only place in America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span> where talent is esteemed on account of
itself,—not because it enables the person endowed with it “to get
handsome things.”</p>

<p>To call a man “visionary,” or to consider his talents useless to
society, because he cannot immediately reduce them into “shoes and
stockings for paupers,” marks a low estimate of humanity; and, in spite
of the greatest political progress, a backward state of civilization.
I have heard gentlemen in the Northern States boast of having worked
sixteen hours a day in a manufactory, or in a store, as if they had
actually benefited the world with their manual labour. The thought
never struck them that they might have been more useful to society
by employing poor men to do the same work for them, and reserving
their faculties, if such they had, for some occupation that had some
relish of intellect in it. As long as the rich men in America think it
more creditable to themselves to compete with the wages of the poor
by assuming a part of their labour, than by cultivating the higher
branches of knowledge to increase the floating intellect, American
society may abound in common sense, but it will prove the grave of
talent and genius. All this, fortunately, does not apply to Washington,
in which the mass of property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> is really so small in proportion to the
intellect that governs it, as to leave a large balance in favour of the
latter.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted but that the vastness of material interests in
the Northern States crushes the loftier aspirings of the mind, though
it may be favourable to a certain degree of elementary instruction and
general information very well compatible with a total neglect of the
higher branches of knowledge, and the absence of taste. It is certainly
a matter of rejoicing, not only for the Americans, but for every
philanthropist, that there should exist at least one country in the
world emphatically to be termed “the land of beef and pudding, clean
shirts, and whole stockings for all;” but in these things does not yet
consist the ultimate happiness of a people, or its capacity for great
and generous actions.</p>

<p>That the great mass of the American people are further advanced, not
only in politics, but in general civilization, than any nation of
Europe, the English themselves not excepted, no one acquainted with
the state of society in the United States will venture to deny: the
question only is, whether that advanced position contains also the
germ of further progress; and whether the direction civilization is
taking in America is sure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> leading to the developement of the higher
faculties. A nation may, like the Germans, be too exclusively engaged
in learned and literary pursuits, and thereby neglect to provide for
those physical comforts which, after all, contribute so much to men’s
happiness; but it is also possible to give to the latter more than
their full share of attention, to the total neglect of every noble and
disinterested pursuit.</p>

<p>The apology one continually hears in the United States, “We are a
young people,”—“you cannot expect us to be as far advanced as other
nations,”—“we have not yet the means,” &amp;c.—are, as regards the
Eastern and Atlantic States, nothing but idle cant. The <i>West</i>
may excuse itself for the want of refinement by the prodigious amount
of labour and personal exertion incidental to the settlement of a
wilderness; but the Northern and Eastern people have no such excuse
for being altogether absorbed in money-making. There is more property
accumulated in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia than in any German
town of the same extent; the intercourse with Europe is constant;
the treasures of science and literature as much unlocked to the
Americans as to any other people; and if, notwithstanding all this,
these departments remain still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> neglected, it can only be because
there is no real taste for them, and because <em>other pursuits are
more sure of securing the respect of society</em>. As long as the
salary of a head-clerk in a respectable counting-room surpasses that
of a professor of mathematics and astronomy in the first and oldest
American university, and as long as the company of the latter is hardly
considered good enough for a wholesale dealer in dry goods or an
auctioneer, it is useless to talk of being “a young people,” “of having
no time for literary pursuits,” &amp;c. The age of the nation has nothing
to do with it; it is <em>the taste of the higher classes</em>, who rather
imitate the follies of fashionable European life, than the European
student in his closet or the munificence of his patron.</p>

<p>“What a boor that fellow is!” exclaimed a Boston lawyer, half audibly,
at a fashionable party in that city, pointing to a young man wearing
boots.—“But, sir, they are dress boots,” said I; “I have seen them
worn by English gentlemen.”—“Oh, then I have no objection to them!”
The young man who wore them had just returned from England, and was
showing off his new fashion. Why do the hundreds and thousands of
young Americans that overrun Europe, and put ministers and consuls
in requisition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span> to be presented at the different courts, not visit
the more humble dwellings of men of letters, or the <i>ateliers</i>
of artists, and on their return show off something else than their
heels?—<i>Answer.</i> “Because the heels are most likely to be
observed; and a man more easily pardoned for ignorance or stupidity
than for unacquaintance with the usages of Europe.” The Americans in
Europe just float on the surface of society, and it is consequently
only the froth of it which they afterwards transplant to their own
country.</p>

<p>Washington, as I have said before, is a city to which people come
to <em>spend</em> money, not to <em>make</em> it. The hum and bustle of
business nowhere obtrude themselves on one’s ears, men’s minds are
occupied with more enlarged views of society; and conversation, instead
of being confined to a narrow circle of common-place observations,
spreads over topics of political and historical interest. In addition
to these advantages, one can already notice in Washington Southern
manners and Southern hospitality. Nothing, indeed, is easier than to
be introduced into the best society; a single letter of introduction
answering all the purpose. Some of the <i lang="fr">habitués</i> seem to make
it their business to procure invitations to parties for strangers.
“What party is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span> there to-night?” you hear a gentleman ask in the
morning.—“It is Mrs. ***’s. Are you invited?”—“I have not the honour
of being introduced.”—“Will you give me your card?”—“With pleasure;”
and in an hour or so your invitation is left at the bar of your hotel.
Many of these parties are indeed supperless, a circumstance much
complained of by the dancers: but then the general tone is agreeable;
the people having far less pretensions, and being much more natural in
their manners, than either the New-Yorkers or the Philadelphians.</p>

</p>


<p>Being engaged in the evening, I spent the time from four till five in
the afternoon in visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> the library of Congress at the Capitol. I
was introduced to the librarian by one of the members, and found him
exceedingly obliging. The collection of books, manuscripts, newspapers,
&amp;c. is of course small, the number of works in any one department being
probably insufficient to form a scholar: yet, for the entertainment
of the members, and for such current and useful instruction as may
be desirable for the purpose of reference, it is probably more than
sufficient; and thus it well answers the purpose of its founders.
After taking from one of the windows a fine view of the city, which
looks more like a newly settled colony than the capital of a powerful
country, I took a walk with two senators and a member up and down the
macadamised road, called the Pennsylvania Avenue, which leads from the
Capitol to the President’s house; this being the fashionable promenade,
business street, habitable quarter, and sum total of the whole American
metropolis.</p>

<p>The two senators belonged to the democratic party, it being a rare case
for a Whig ever to associate with a Democrat, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>;
the member of the House belonged to the same class of politicians.</p>

<p>“What sort of speech was it <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> to-day?” demanded one of the
senators of the member.</p>

<p>“Clever enough, I believe; but nobody listened to it. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> *** speaks
too much.”</p>

<p>“And on all occasions, probably?”</p>

<p>“Precisely so.”</p>

<p>“Then I do not wonder no one likes to hear him: it is the worst
possible taste to be always up. A man has to be very careful with
that. The older members do not like the younger ones to speak more on
a question than is absolutely necessary. This privilege is entirely
reserved for the veterans. A young man of talent must be cautious how
he shows off; or they will make a dead set at him, and hunt him down.
The best practice is to speak seldom, and only on great occasions.”</p>

<p>“But you know,” observed the member, “a man must give some signs
of life, or he will not be re-elected. Most of our speeches are
manufactured for home-consumption. We ‘let fly’ at them in the House,
then print it, and then send a couple of thousand copies of it to our
constituents. Uncle Sam, you know, pays the postage.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“None of us has a right to complain about that,” replied the senator:
“speeches are made on both sides; each party possessing the same right,
and making the same use of the privilege of franking.”</p>

<p>“But then our party does not make near as long speeches as the Tories:
it is only the higher classes of society will read a discourse filling
more than seventeen columns in a newspaper.”</p>

<p>“But how do they get people to listen to them?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“They don’t,” answered the member. “We just let him speak on, and
employ our time in reading the newspapers, writing letters, conversing
with one another, talking to some gentleman in the lobby, or in reading
some interesting book. We always find some useful occupation: it is
only the greenhorns listen to a long speech, with a view to catch an
idea.”</p>

<p>“Reading is sometimes practised with great success,” observed the
senator, “while a personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span> attack is made upon a gentleman. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van
Buren,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> for instance, is in the habit of reading a novel as often as
a Whig or Tory senator gets up to pour out his abuse against him. In
this manner he is not only able to weather the storm without getting
angry, but to show at the same time his contempt for the invective.”</p>

<p>“That is a capital plan. I presume he occasionally looks over the
book?” said the member with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Only when the abuse is very heavy; and then it is done with the most
placid countenance, just to let his antagonist know how little he can
shake him. It serves in the place of a reply, and keeps his party all
the while in countenance.”</p>

<p>“But what must a member or a senator do to obtain a hearing from his
colleagues?” demanded I.</p>

<p>“Why, he must have friends, either political or personal, and he must
know how to keep his audience in good humour; a task which is more
difficult than you imagine.”</p>

<p>The conversation then turned upon General Jackson, and the prospects of
the opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“General Jackson,” said one of the senators, “understands the people of
the United States twenty times better than his antagonists; and, if his
successor have but half the same tact, the Whigs may give up the hope
of governing the country for the next half century.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to say ‘<em>tact</em>,’” interrupted the other senator,
“for that alone will not do it; he must have the same manners as our
present President. General Jackson has a peculiar way of addressing
himself to the feelings of every man with whom he comes in contact. His
simple, unostentatious manners carry into every heart the conviction of
his honesty; while the firmness of his character inspires his friends
with the hope of success. His motto always was, ‘<em>Never sacrifice
a friend to an enemy</em>;’ or, ‘<em>Make yourself strong with your
friends, and you need not fear your foes.</em>’ These things, however,
must be <em>born</em> with a man; they must be spontaneous, and felt as
such by the people, or they lose the best part of their effect. All the
tact in the world will not answer the same purpose; for, in exactly the
same proportion as we perceive a man is prudent, we become cautious
ourselves,—and then farewell to popularity!</p>

<p>“When the people give their suffrages to a man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> they never do so
on a rigid examination of his political principles; for this task
the labouring classes of any country neither have the time nor the
disposition, and it is wholly needless to attempt to persuade them to a
different course by a long and tedious argument. The large masses act
in politics pretty much as they do in religion. Every doctrine is with
them, more or less, a matter of <em>faith</em>; received, principally,
on account of their trust in the apostle. If the latter fail to
captivate their hearts, no reasoning in the world is capable of filling
the vacancy: and the more natural and uncorrupt the people are, the
less are they to be moved by abstract reasoning, whether the form of
government be republican, monarchical, or despotic.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” ejaculated the member. “General Jackson is popular,
just because he is General Jackson; so much so, that if a man were to
say a word against him in the Western States, he would be ‘<em>knocked
into eternal smash</em>.’”</p>

<p>“And this sort of popularity,” continued the senator, “our Northern
people consider as the mere consequence of the battle of New Orleans.
The battle, and General Jackson’s military character, had undoubtedly
a great deal to do with it; but they were not of themselves sufficient
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> elevate him to the Presidency. In a country in which so large a
portion of the people consider the acquiring of a fortune the only
rational object of pursuit,—in which so great and so exclusive an
importance is attached to money, that, with a few solitary exceptions,
it is the only means of arriving at personal distinction,—a character
like Jackson’s, so perfectly disinterested, and so entirely devoted to
what he at least deemed the good of his country, could not but excite
astonishment and admiration among the natural, and therefore more
susceptible, people of the Western States. The appearance of General
Jackson was a phenomenon, and would at the present time have been one
in every country. He called himself ‘the people’s friend,’ and gave
proofs of his sincerity and firmness in <em>adhering</em> to his friends,
and of his power to protect them. The people believed in General
Jackson as much as the Turks in their prophet, and would have followed
him wherever he chose to lead them. With this species of popularity it
is in vain to contend; and it betrays little knowledge of the world,
and the springs of human action, to believe those who possess it men of
ordinary capacity.</p>

<p>“What the French call ‘<i lang="fr">le génie du caractère</i>,’ which is the
true talisman of popular favour, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span> perhaps the highest talent with
which mortals can be endowed. It is a pure gift of Heaven, and has
accomplished the noblest deeds in history. When Napoleon reproached
Voltaire with not having sufficiently appreciated the character of
Mahomed, whom the French poet introduced in the drama of the same
name as a mere impostor, he felt that none but a great mind could
have conceived and executed what to ordinary men would have appeared
absurd or chimerical; and that he who had the power to instil a lasting
enthusiasm for a new cause into millions, and on that enthusiasm to
establish an empire which has spread over half the world, must have
been more than a mere charlatan, for he must have been possessed of a
thorough knowledge of human character. This is a thing a man cannot
acquire by study, if he do not possess it by intuition; and hence it
can neither be defined nor understood by men not similarly gifted, who,
applying their own scale to what is truly incommensurable, are always
astonished at the success of those whom they were all their lives
accustomed to look upon as second or third rate men.</p>

<p>“Have we not heard it objected to Napoleon, that he could not write an
elegant epistle? Do the French not pity Shakspeare for having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
so little of a scholar, and so inelegant in his expressions? And yet
wherein consisted the particular genius of these men, so entirely
opposite to one another, if it was not, principally, in the perfect
knowledge which truly intuitively they possessed of human character?</p>

<p>“In the same manner it has been said of General Jackson that he
is incapable of writing a good English sentence, as if this were
the standard by which to measure the capacity of a political
chief, especially in America, where, out of a hundred senators and
representatives, scarcely one has received what in Europe would be
called a literary education. If classical learning were to constitute
the scale by which to measure the talents of our statesmen, how far
would they not rank behind the paltriest Prussian schoolmaster!
General Jackson understood the people of the United States better
than, perhaps, any President before him, and developed as much energy
in his administration as any American statesman. I do not here speak
as a partisan, nor do I wish to inquire whether all his measures were
beneficial to the people; but they were, at least, all in unison with
his political doctrines, and carried through with an iron consequence,
notwithstanding the enormous opposition that wealth, and, in a
great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> degree, also talent, put in the way of their execution. And
yet they call Jackson a second-rate man, because he is not a regular
<em>speechifyer</em>, or has never published a long article in the
newspapers!</p>

<p>“To judge of a man like General Jackson, one must not analyze him
after the manner of a chemist; one must not separate his talents—his
oratory—his style of composition—his generalship, &amp;c.; but take the
<i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> of the man, and I venture to say there is not such
another in the United States. It is useless to draw envious comparisons
between him and Washington, Wellington, Napoleon, Jefferson, and
so forth. Great men always wear the imprints of the times and
circumstances which call their talents into action; but history is
sure to preserve the name of any man who has had the strength and
genius to stamp his own character on the people over whose destinies he
presided. General Jackson has many political enemies, and his political
doctrines are perhaps only maintained—I will not say maintainable—by
his own great personality. His successor in office may not be able to
continue to make head against the opposition;—another party may get
into power, and introduce different doctrines into the administration
of the country;—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span> the impulse which General Jackson has given to
the democracy of America will always continue to be felt, and impel the
government in a more or less popular direction.”</p>

<p>“You are a great friend of General Jackson,” said I, “from the animated
defence you make of his character.”</p>

<p>“I certainly am, sir,” said he; “and I do not know a single man of our
party that is not warmly attached to him. Not that I approve of all
his political principles; but I like the man, and would rather see
<em>him</em> President than any other.”</p>

<p>“You have spoken my very heart,” cried the other senator. “I like
<i>Old Hickory</i>, because he is just the man for the people, and as
immovable as a rock. One always knows where to find him.”</p>

<p>“He is just the man our party wanted,” rejoined the first senator, “in
order to take the lead.”</p>

<p>“And I like Old Ironhead,” said the member, “because he is a man after
my own sort. When he once says he is your friend, he <em>is</em> your
friend; but once your enemy, then <em>look out for breakers</em>.”</p>

<p>“And, what is more,” interrupted the senator, “his hatred is of that
pure Saxon kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> which is always coupled with moral horror; and, for
that reason, irreconcileable.”</p>

<p>“And, what is better than all,” cried the member, chuckling, “he has
a good memory; he never forgets a man who has rendered him a service,
nor does he ever cease to remember an injury. The former is sure of
being rewarded, the latter will with difficulty escape punishment. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Adams, during his Presidency, was pusillanimous enough to endeavour to
reconcile his enemies by all sorts of <i>douceurs</i>; he appointed
them to office, invited them to dinner, and distinguished them even
before his friends. This conduct naturally alienated the latter; while
the former, perceiving his drift, did not think themselves bound to be
grateful for his attentions. General Jackson introduced the doctrine
of reward and punishment, and has ‘<em>got along</em>’ with it much
better than his warmest friends anticipated. He appointed his friends
to office, and dismissed his antagonists the moment they had taken an
active part in politics. That principle, sir, is the proper one to go
upon. The hope of reward, and the fear of punishment, govern men in
politics and religion.”</p>

<p>“You have expressed some apprehension,” said I, turning to the senator,
“that <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> whom I suppose you mean by the successor of
General Jackson, might not be able to retain the reins of government
long.”</p>

<p>“If I did so,” replied the senator, “it was not because <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren’s
principles are not fully as orthodox as Jackson’s; but he will be
called on the stage immediately after a great actor will have left it,
in order to perform a part not <em>originally</em> intended for him. He
may be a much greater statesman than General Jackson, and yet fail to
satisfy the country. He may not be allowed to act out his own views,
and unable to identify himself with the party as General Jackson
did,—be reduced to an exceedingly precarious position. Besides, his
means of reward, as my friend chooses to call them, will be limited;
General Jackson having already distributed the best offices among his
friends, and the power of creating new ones being with great reluctance
granted by the people. As regards the power of punishment, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van
Buren will be left entirely impotent; General Jackson having already
cleared the vineyard of the most noxious weeds, and the dismissal from
office of a person appointed by Jackson being sure of raising a hue and
cry throughout the country.”</p>

<p>“All that may be,” observed the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span> senator; “but <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren is
a shrewd man.”</p>

<p>“So he is; but all the shrewdness in the world will not change the
disagreeable predicament in which he will be placed at the resignation
of General Jackson. I am still afraid of the bank question.”</p>

<p>“That is long ago knocked on the head.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was; but I cannot bring myself to think so. The smallest
commercial crisis—and our country is continually exposed to the
largest ones—may revive the hopes of the opposition. It is the
peculiar curse of our country never to come to a lasting conclusion
on any political principle. What is law under one administration is
abolished under another, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, just as the one or the
other party happens to command a majority of votes.</p>

<p>“What doctrine may now be considered as settled in the United
States?—Not one; except that we are opposed to royalty—principally on
account of its expenses. There is the system of internal improvements;
have we come to a conclusion with regard to that?—No; the democratic
party merely let it fall through, in order that the Whigs on obtaining
power may take it up again. There is the American system with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> the high
tariff; how does that question stand?—The parties are precisely in the
same position in which they were before the passing of the Compromise
Bill in 1832-3; the North calling for a protective system, and the
South determined to nullify.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And so it is with the question of a
United States’ bank, the merit of each principle being every year newly
tested by the result of the elections. This state of things is far from
being enviable, as it renders the possession of property every day more
and more insecure.”</p>

<p>“Not only does it render property insecure,” rejoined the other
senator, “but it undermines the stability of our institutions. Instead
of adhering to the text of the <em>constitution</em>, our parties are
led by different <em>policies</em>. There is the tariff policy; as
if manufacturing, or getting rich by selling home made cotton and
broad-cloth, were the last end proposed by government. Then comes the
national improvement policy; people must have large roads and canals
in order to force trade into one or the other direction. They cannot
wait until the wants of commerce shall have called them into existence;
neither will they rely upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> private enterprise for their execution:
it must be done by the protecting guardianship of the government, and
the whole country <i lang="fr">en masse</i> must contribute to benefit particular
States. Then comes the question of a national bank; which has agitated
the country before it was quite ushered into the world, and ever after.
What great national question has occupied public attention more than
the art, science, practice, custom, and expediency of making money? It
has employed all the wisdom, all the discretion, and all the energies
of our statesmen; clearly indicating what direction the republic of the
nineteenth century would take, and wherein consists the greatness of
our times.</p>

<p>“All these questions have been so continually agitated that we have
found no time for anything else; and yet we wonder Europeans do not
take a sufficient interest in the progress of our country. What have
we done that is so very marvellous? We have, thanks to the infinite
resources of our country, built more railroads and canals than
<em>they</em> have; we have built and blown up more steam-boats; and
we have, in proportion to our population, a larger mercantile navy
than any other people. But what progress have we made in the arts and
sciences, in literature, or in philosophy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> to entitle us to be ranked
foremost in the scale of nations? There exists now an international
literature among the civilized nations of the world. What share do
we take in that? The present age is in labour to give birth to a new
order of things, to a new era in history; what is America doing to aid
the delivery?—she who has had so much to do with the conception, and
who is now responsible to the world if the whole prove an abortion. Is
not every such sympathy expressed by our people—I mean by the mass of
our population—laughed to scorn by our ‘respectable’ citizens; and
are not nine-tenths of all the Americans travelling in Europe a living
parody of our republican institutions? Has not even Cooper written half
a dozen books on England, Italy, France, &amp;c. as if his main purpose
were to teach his countrymen good manners, and to convince them that
he is a competent instructor, having himself been admitted into the
best society? Why, if the speeches of our fashionable gentlemen were
published in Europe, if <em>their</em> estimation of our people and of
our institutions were taken as a criterion of the justice and strength
of our government, then the state of our country might, indeed, be held
up <i lang="la">in terrorem</i> to every nation aspiring to liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“What have we achieved to be proud of, if it be not our national
charter? And is not this expounded by every party in a different
manner? We do not even seem to know whether we shall really have
a republican government, or whether our constitution shall be a
mere mock-word, granting to the people in theory what a large and
influential portion of our citizens endeavour to deny them in practice.
As long as our institutions are looked upon as a mere experiment, not
only by a certain class in Europe, but by the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of our
<em>own</em> people; as long as our fashionable toadies pour out their
contempt for popular governments in the ante-chambers of princes and
nobles; and as long as our enlightened press finds no better food for
the patriotism of our people than to entertain them with the court
fashions and the court etiquette of Europe,—we have no right to find
fault with the literary and thinking portion of Europeans for not
wondering at our progress, or not thinking us the very first nation in
the world.</p>

<p>“To boast of the inexhaustible resources of the country God in his
infinite mercy has granted us for the noblest experiment; to be proud
of our getting rich, of our being well-fed and well-clothed; and
to look down with a mixture of pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span> and contempt on the millions
which in less favoured climes are struggling against hunger and
despotism,—proves a degree of vulgar egotism against which European
writers have a right to use every weapon with which sarcasm and
ridicule can furnish them.</p>

<p>“Instead of bawling like little children when we are hurt by some
European critic, let us be sufficiently independent to go on
fearlessly, and without reference to the fashions of other nations,
in the developement of those maxims and principles which have led to
the establishment of our government. Let every nation develope and
improve that to which it is principally indebted for its existence and
power, instead of continually borrowing from others, and introducing
heterogeneous elements into the state, which can only weaken its
cohesion. The peculiar genius of our people is their capacity for
self-government. Let them follow the inspiration of that genius, and
esteem themselves for their <em>real</em> worth, and they will have no
need of fearing the sting of European sarcasm.”</p>

<p>“That’s it—that’s it exactly!” shouted the member. “Instead of going
on ‘gloriously,’ ‘irresistibly,’ and ‘triumphantly,’ we stop all the
time to pick up knowledge in Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“There is enough knowledge to be picked up in Europe for you or me,”
replied the senator with a significant look on the member; “but, when
our people go to Europe, they pick up the weed, and overlook the
wholesome plant. We have no discrimination in our choice; and hence
most of our countrymen, when they return home from abroad, arrive in a
poisoned state, and immediately infect their neighbourhood. We ought to
establish a sort of moral quarantine at the entrance of all our ports,
where we ought to retain gentlemen and ladies returning from Europe,
until they should have given symptoms of returning reason.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what <em>I</em> say,” cried the member. “I wish somebody
would make such a motion!”</p>

<p>“Is it not strange,” continued the senator, “that we, who are descended
from the English, should resemble them so little in one respect? The
English carry their national customs and manners wherever they go;
whereas we, poor unfortunate Yankees! with the sympathy of half the
world in our favour, are absolutely ashamed of our own, and embarrassed
when asked about the nature of our government.”</p>

<p>“If any such there be, I wish I knew their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span> names,” interrupted the
member; “they ought to be published.”</p>

<p>“That would be ungentlemanly,” retorted the senator, vexed with the
interruption; “you would surely not introduce a reign of terror!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” ejaculated the member; “I am the man for the
people, and, when any one insults them, my <em>dander</em> is up; and
then I don’t know <em>what</em> I am doing.”</p>

<p>The senator made no reply.</p>

<p>“There are men in Paris,” continued he after a while, “who do more
harm to their countrymen than all the books that have been written on
America.”</p>

<p>“And who are they?” demanded the member eagerly.</p>

<p>“I shall not name them,” said the senator; “but they are some of our
vulgar rich men, and the very worst hunters after nobility. One of
them gives fine parties, and has by his extravagance acquired a sort
of notoriety which he is mistaking for reputation. This man, who is
much more proud of his intercourse with French noblemen than of his
familiarity with his own countrymen, while at Florence actually refused
to recognise one of our worthiest citizens whom he well knew, and
whom the Grand Duke had received on several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> occasions.—‘Do you know
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> ***’ asked the Imperial Prince of Austria, the lion of Paris.—‘I
do not,’ replied the latter, somewhat abashed.—‘He has certainly a
very agreeable family,’ observed his Highness, by way of explaining
his motive.—‘That may be,’ answered the wealthy nothing; ‘but he is
a <em>merchant</em>, and I do not associate with these.’—‘Indeed!’
remarked the Grand Duke naïvely, ‘I was always told the merchants
composed your best society!’”</p>

<p>“And I dare say,” said the member, “he would have been glad, while in
America, to be ranked with the society of merchants.”</p>

<p>“It is the character of every toad-eater,” observed the senator drily,
“that he ceases to recognise his friends the moment they can no longer
be useful to him. There are toad-eaters in politics as well as in
society. A man may be a toad-eater to the mob as well as to those above
him; and I do not know which of the two kinds is the worst. We have a
set of political sycophants who fawn and cringe before every party that
is in power, and who are always the first to desert them at the least
<i lang="fr">mauvais contretemps</i>. Our democracy has no greater enemies than
those twaddles. They come over to the side of the people when they have
no other alternative left,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> and are the servants of the people just as
long as the people have the power to retain them. They are democrats
for a share in the loaves and fishes, and injure the party more than
its most avowed opponents; just as treachery in your own ranks is worse
than an attack from your enemy.”</p>

<p>“But I should think people would soon find them out,” observed the
member.</p>

<p>“They may indeed very easily be detected,” said the senator; “only
the <em>people</em> find them out too late. One of the surest means
of detecting them is to watch their animosity against harmless
individuals, while they show the greatest delicacy for persons who have
the power to injure them. These men are always ready to kill the fly
that annoys them, but move quietly out of the way of the elephant; they
never show their courage unless they are quite sure of opposing the
weak, or, like Falstaff at the battle of Shrewsbury, merely stab the
slain.”</p>

<p>The conversation here began to flag; and, in a short time after, the
honourable member, under pretext of having a pressing engagement with
a friend, left us to enjoy the rest of our walk as best we might,
without the advantage of his remarks. I seized this opportunity to ask
the senator whether what I had heard of the poverty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> the city of
Washington was true, and whether the town is really deserted during the
summer?</p>

<p>“I am glad,” replied he, “the people here are poor, and unable to
give splendid entertainments. They would otherwise have the power of
seducing senators and representatives with the display of fashion, and
the numerous attractions and manœuvres of wealthy coteries. It is a
fortunate circumstance that the legislative assemblies of the States of
New York and Pennsylvania meet in comparatively small towns; because
not only the influence of the mob, which Jefferson dreaded, but also
the aristocratic seductions of the higher classes, are capable of
destroying the independence of legislators. From these evils we are
happily exempted by the almost hopeless condition of the inhabitants of
this place. Washington is, in this respect, like a German university,
in which all the citizens make their living by the students and the
professors, and on that account must do what the latter like, instead
of holding out inducements for them to desert the path of duty. With
the exception of half a dozen people of large estates, and particularly
the very generous and hospitable General V—ss, all the parties,
entertainments, balls, concerts, etc. are given by the <i lang="fr">corps
diplomatique</i>, or by the gentlemen holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> office, among whom some
of the secretaries are particularly remarkable for their unostentatious
civility to strangers. The company, again, is principally composed of
persons connected with the government, of senators, members of the
House, and foreign diplomatic agents; so that the rich visitors from
the Atlantic towns are incapable of making a sensation, and are only
admitted on even terms.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very flattering account of Washington society,” said I,
delighted with the prospect.</p>

<p>“If you are this evening invited to Mrs. ***’s, you may probably have
an opportunity of verifying all I have said. The meagre salaries of
our public functionaries do not enable them to pamper their guests
with hot suppers, as is the custom among the nabobs of New York; but
if agreeable and affable manners, and the <i lang="fr">réunion</i> of the first
talents of our country, can compensate you for a leg of a turkey or
an oyster-pie, you will not regret staying a few days in the American
metropolis.”</p>

<p>So saying, he bid me good-b’ye; begged me to make use of him in
any manner I pleased, especially if I wished to be introduced to
the President and Vice-president, or to any of his colleagues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
on <em>his</em> side of the question. I thanked him cordially for
his kindness; and, intending to pay my respects to the President
and Vice-president, told him frankly that I should be under great
obligations to him for a personal introduction to General Jackson and
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren. This declaration had the desired effect, and it was
agreed between us that he should call on me early on the morning of the
following day in order to present me to the chief magistrate.</p>

<p>“The greatest problem of the human race, to the solution of which men
are forced by the peculiarity of their nature, is the establishment of
a society for the maintenance of their rights.”—<i>Kant’s Idea of a
Universal History in a Cosmopolitical Sense.</i></p>
</div>


<p>On my return to the hotel I found the people at tea, which was served
with beefsteaks, chops, ham, &amp;c. and answered the purpose of a regular
meal. It being too early for me to join them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> I quietly sneaked off
to my room, or rather to the third part of a room, which was granted
me by the kindness of the innkeeper; the other two-thirds, with the
corresponding beds, &amp;c. being occupied by a lieutenant in the navy,
and a young man of fashion just returned from Europe, who, in proof of
his foreign civilization, was constantly singing French songs without
reference to melody or metre. One of these, which he usually sang in
the morning, when owing to our late rising we got a cold breakfast, I
yet remember had this singular <i>refrain</i>:—</p>

<p class="poetry" lang="fr">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Je suis content, je suis heureux;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tout homme doit l’être dans ces lieux.”</span><br>
</p>

<p>Being afraid lest the songster should enter the room, and dispute with
me the use of the only looking-glass, I dressed as quickly as I could;
and then went down to the reading-room, to drag out the time from six
till eight with the newspapers. The appointed hour finally arrived,
and with it the carriage I had previously engaged; and in less than
three-quarters of an hour,—the house of Mrs. *** being situated on the
confines of the ideal town,—my “negro driver” halted before a small
building with a wooden staircase in front, which looked as though it
might be blown off by the first gale, or washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> away by the rain,
considering that it was exposed to the unmitigated fury of both, and
evidently placed there for no other purpose but to save room for the
kitchen. The house, which was so uncommonly snug as to have but three
windows in front, was brilliantly illumined by the aid of a single
chandelier; and the door left open, in order that the invited guests
might see their way up stairs into the parlour.</p>

<p>Arrived at the place, my coachman sprung off the box, opened the door
of the carriage, and assisted me in alighting amidst a group of dark
faces that were only rendered visible by the reflection from the
whites of their eyes. I passed the review of the servants without
loss of time, and scrambled up the wooden staircase in order to
force my entrance into the parlour. This, however, was in vain; the
gentlemen, who, much against their own inclination, were placed with
their faces in the room and the more vulgar part of their composition
outside, being unable to move forward, in order to admit the ingress
of a new-comer, without interfering with the dancers. I tried to look
<em>into</em> the room, in order to have at least a peep at the ladies;
but, measuring but five feet ten, and the two gentlemen who guarded the
entrance being probably Kentuckians, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> not manage to look over
their shoulders. I endeavoured to have a glance between their bodies,
or between their shoulders and arms. Vain attempt! they were too
compact to suffer a beam of light to go through them.</p>

<p>In despair I went up another pair of stairs, which led into a sort of
refectory, to which the entrance, though difficult, was not impossible.
The room was furnished in a befitting style of simplicity. There was no
display of overgrown wealth; a few painted chairs and tables, a small
ebony-framed looking-glass, and a few settees,—the bed having been
previously ejected in order to make room for the company,—constituting
the sum total of the <i>ameublement</i>. On a small side-table, neatly
covered with a white table-cloth, were placed several large plates of
sandwiches, bread and ham; and in the middle of the room stood a large
basin, which at first I took for a Roman bathing-tub, placed there
for the accommodation of such guests as came from a distance, but, on
drawing near, discovered to be full of that exquisite beverage called
“apple toddy,” which differs very little from <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Price’s gin punch at
the Garrick, so much approved of by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Theodore Hook. Indeed, I rather
think the advantage, if any, on the side of the toddy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> apples
imparting to the gin a much more simple and delicate flavour than the
Maraschino; and the thing would be better still if iced soda-water were
added to the compound.</p>

<p>The gentlemen formed a very interesting group round this tub; and,
perceiving a stranger step amongst them, immediately made room; while
one of them, probably the president <i lang="la">pro tem</i>, seized a huge
ladle, and immersing it first into the liquid, and holding it up again
in triumph as high as he could, filled a more than double-sized glass
to the very brim without spilling one drop of the liquid. This feat,
which convinced me at once of his being an <i lang="fr">habitué</i>, was scarcely
accomplished, before, in the most graceful manner possible, he offered
me the glass with the amicable greeting of—</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Every stranger is welcome in Washington!”</span><br>
</p>

<p>I of course pledged him in due politeness, and in less than five
minutes felt perfectly acquainted with the whole company. I then made
a second attempt at forcing an entrance into the ball-room, which, the
Kentuckians being gone, and their places filled by two spindle-shanked
heroes of New York, succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations;
admitting me not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span> into the room, but into the presence of the lady
of the house. Having been invited only through the kind intercession of
a friend, without knowing mine hostess, and the custom of announcing by
servants being not yet introduced into the United States, a gentleman
who acted as usher immediately offered me his arm, and led me into the
presence of an elderly lady, dressed rather in the English matron style
than <i lang="fr">à la française</i>, and whose countenance betokened a life
passed in domestic peace and comfort.</p>

<p>The gentleman introduced me as <i>Monsieur</i> <span class="allsmcap">DE</span> ***,
much against my own inclination, and I could clearly perceive the
consequence that little word <i>de</i> gave me; not so much with the
lady of the house, as with a number of fashionable misses, strangers
in the metropolis, “who had just come out that season.” I do not know
whether <em>vanity</em> had something to do with it, but I thought I
heard one of them ask whether I was a bachelor; which question being
answered in the affirmative, I am quite sure I heard another one say,
“Hem! I dare say he is as poor as that Polish Count ***, who flirted
with every young lady, and, when it came to the scratch, had hardly
money enough to pay the parson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>This common-sense remark of an American belle, which proved in a most
satisfactory manner her preferring the useful to the agreeable, did
not much affect me; neither did I ascribe it to the want of liberality
towards strangers, having seen <i>native Americans</i> victimized in
the same manner. I therefore pretended not to have heard the remark,
and asked the gentleman who acted as master of the ceremonies to have
the kindness to introduce me to the lady who, I thought, had inquired
whether I was married.</p>

<p>I found her well-educated, <i lang="fr">spirituelle</i>,—full of imagination.
I even think she gave me to understand that she once wrote poetry—as
an exercise at the boarding-school, and that she always had a secret
attachment to men of letters. Among the various English writers,
she was most in love with Scott, who completely transported her to
the times of chivalry and knight-errantry; while her own countryman
Cooper was to her “an object of perfect horror,” though she had no
particular objection to his last works, “which contain a great deal of
information about the state of society in Europe.” She “<em>longed</em>
to see Europe; and was very much indebted to mamma for bringing her
to Washington, where she could already have a foretaste of it.” On
hearing this, her mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span> who stood near her, said that she was a
child, and that I must not listen to her. Being really not disposed for
a flirtation, and seeing the same senator with whom I had taken a walk
in the afternoon enter the room, I was glad to find an opportunity of
leaving my sentimental fair one to the care of her tender parent, who
had instilled into her such delicate tastes.</p>

<p>When the senator saw that I was disengaging myself, he came up to me
without ceremony, shook me by the hand, and asked me how I liked the
party. I related to him my adventure in the upper room, which made him
smile. “You may depend upon it,” said he, “that if ever you meet with
any of those gentlemen in the neighbourhood of his estate, you will not
be able to get off with less than a month’s stay at his house,—such
would be his hospitality, and the pleasure of meeting you again. I must
now lead you round a little, in order to show you some of our most
remarkable characters.</p>

<p>“That man there, with white hair and dark keen eyes, who so violently
gesticulates, is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Wise, a member from Virginia. He is a paragon
of American speakers,—always up, always ready, always determined to
speak, on every occasion, the modicum of two or three hours, were it
but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> show his friends and constituents that he is ‘up and doing.’ He
is a member of the Whig opposition; fighting against the government as
against a hydra with many heads, all which <em>he</em> has to sever from
the trunk. His contempt for the present administration knows neither
bounds nor reason; and he is opposed to every one of its measures, to
every member or senator that ever seconded or defended one of these,
and to every man that ever voted for any such member or senator. He
goes, in fact, ‘the whole hog t’other way,’ and, as such, is the very
type of an American Whig. He carries his opposition almost to madness,
though amongst his numerous speeches there are a good many clever ones.”</p>

<p>“I could never tell the object of your Whig party,” said I; “pray, what
<em>are</em> its peculiar principles?”</p>

<p>“Our appellation of <i>Whigs</i> or <i>Conservatives</i>, and
<i>Tories</i>, <i>Democrats</i>, or <i>Destructives</i>,” replied he,
“must really puzzle the English. I would ask, what have <em>our</em>
Conservatives to preserve? What our Destructives to destroy? Our
Conservatives possess no exclusive rights, no privileges beyond those
enjoyed by the people at large; their names are not associated with
the history of the country; their ancestors, if they were known,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> had
nothing to do with establishing the government,—for the <i>mania</i>
for aristocracy is least to be found among those families whose
forefathers distinguished themselves in the revolutionary war;
they hold no property which the first commercial crisis may not
destroy; and hold, in fact, the very <em>reverse</em> position of the
Conservatives in England. They do not endeavour to <em>preserve</em>
what they <em>possess</em>, but strive to <em>acquire more</em>; they are
not associated with the <em>past</em>, but entertain bright hopes of the
<em>future</em>; they do not stand on the broad basis of the history of
their own country, but seek for precedent in Europe. This, sir, is the
character of <em>our</em> Conservatives, Whigs, or Aristocrats, who bear
no more resemblance to the English Tories, than a poor man, who tries
to become rich by shaving his neighbour, does to a millionnaire who
defends his own property.</p>

<p>“You must not be misled by the idle declamations of those who
incessantly talk of the levelling system, and its consequences on the
people of this country. The levelling system commenced at the very
settlement of the country, and was most active during the revolution.
It was then that the Conservatives, with some show of logic, might have
declaimed against the levelling principle; not now. There are some
who will gravely tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> you that the most eminent American statesmen,
during the revolution and immediately after, were Conservatives, or
moderate Tories; but what does this prove, if it be true? Simply,
that a great number of those whom an overruling Providence used as
instruments in bestowing liberty and happiness on our people, did not
understand what they were doing: which, after all, does not make so
very much against them; there being at all times, and in all countries,
but few politicians capable of foreseeing the ultimate result of an
innovation. And what, I would ask, have nine-tenths of these Tories
to lose by this levelling system, that makes them so tenacious of
their doctrines? Where is the elevation from which they are afraid
to descend? What noble principles which they cherish, will thereby
be trodden in the dust? What protection which they give to arts and
sciences, will thereby suffer? Echo must answer, ‘What?’—Daniel
Webster, the gentleman there with the hawk-eyes, told us that the war
between the democrats and the aristocracy is a war of the poor against
the rich; and I am inclined to think he is half right,—as far, namely,
as concerns his own party. But if wealth form the only distinction, the
only claim to supremacy in our country, the sooner we get rid of its
influence the better.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span> It is the most degrading of all, and must be
equally spurned by the labourer and the man of genius.”</p>

<p>“But a great number of your literary men belong likewise to the
opposition.”</p>

<p>“Pray, don’t talk to me of our literary men! We have as yet, for the
most part, but literary imitators, who follow the beaten track of the
English or French; and the organization of our society is admirably
calculated to retain them in this state of imbecility. It is the want
of nationality, the absence of generous and expanded feelings, which
are crushed by the vulgar inordinate desire after money, and the little
love which our upper classes in general bear to the institutions of our
country, which are the cause of our poets singing the praise of the
lark and the nightingale, with whose melodious strains they are only
acquainted through the medium of some English annual. What is there
in our country to inspire poetic sentiments, if it be not the love of
liberty and of nature, the great sources of all poetry?</p>

<p>“We are told that our political principles are bad, because they do
not meet with the approbation of some two or three score of vain
scribblers calling themselves <i>literati</i>, but being in fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
pettifogging lawyers, that have not wit enough to make a living by
their profession. Now, in order to prove such an assertion to be
correct, it would first be necessary to show that these representatives
of the wisdom, intelligence, and patriotism of the country are capable
of forming a correct judgment of the position and wants of our people;
and, secondly, that they are capable of forming an <em>independent</em>
judgment. When our <i>literati</i> shall be known otherwise than by
writing for the newspapers, or occasionally for an album, I shall
believe the first; when I shall see a paper without advertisements, I
shall trust in the second.</p>

<p>“We talk of an independent press, and our editors are more easily
bought and sold than any writer in France! They are, indeed, not
bought by so much money down, simply because there is none to give
it them; but by contributions of twenty-five dollars a-piece for
<em>annual advertisements</em>, paid at the end of the year,—if the
subscriber does not fail in the mean time. Our <i>literati</i> want to
make a living with their pen, and are in this respect just like other
tradespeople.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, pointing to a young man dressed in the latest London
fashion, “is a gentleman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> the son of a respectable merchant in New
York, who may serve as an illustration of what <em>we</em> mean by a
Tory. He is just turned twenty-one, and has already been in France,
England, and Italy. His father is rich; that is, he associates with
fashionable people, keeps a carriage, and will, if he do not meet
with great reverses, leave to his six children from fifteen to twenty
thousand dollars a head. This modicum the young man will have to
improve, or he will die a beggar; so that, if he does not marry a
rich woman, he will be unavoidably condemned to personal labour and
exertion. Yet this young man is <em>an aristocrat</em>! His father,
knowing his inability to provide for him in such a manner as to render
him independent, thought fit to give him a <em>practical</em> rather than
a literary education. The young man accordingly <em>learned</em> reading,
writing, and spelling; writes a tolerably fair hand, and has studied
mathematics—as far as the rule of three! When he had acquired so much
of a practical education, he was sent to Europe to <em>perfect</em>
himself.</p>

<p>“He first went to England, where he saw all the great actors and
actresses, went up <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s to take a view of the city of London,
made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> round of the principal gambling-houses and other public
establishments worth the attention of a traveller, dined with every
gentleman to whom he brought a letter of introduction, and then wrote
home, that, being perfectly acquainted with English society, he was
now desirous of seeing France. His father accordingly sent the money,
and the young man set out in a stage-coach from London to Dover. From
Dover to Boulogne he went in a steamer; and at Boulogne he took the
<i>malle-poste</i> for Paris, making observations all the way on the
manners of the French people.</p>

<p>“Arrived in Paris, his first care was to secure comfortable lodgings;
then he delivered his letter of introduction, which was a letter of
credit on Messrs. *** and Co.; then dined with his banker; after which
he dined again at a <i>restaurant</i>’s, and then set out to prepare
for his daily avocation, which consisted in strolling from his lodgings
in the Rue Rivoli, through the Rue <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Honoré, to the Palais Royal;
from the Palais Royal, through the Rue Vivienne, to the Place de la
Bourse; thence through the Passage du Panorama to the Boulevards; and
over the Boulevards, through the Rue de la Paix and the Place Vendôme,
into the garden of the Tuileries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span> which, together with the principal
theatres and other places of amusement, contained his circle of
acquaintance in the French metropolis.</p>

<p>“Society in France being a little easier of access than in England,
he obtained, by dint of perseverance,—one of our cardinal
virtues,—access to one or two respectable families, and left his
card with our minister in order to be presented at court. Whether he
was actually admitted into ‘the presence of royalty,’ after which his
heart panted ever since he was a boy, I know not; but I rather think he
<em>was</em>, since, immediately on his return, he cut most of his old
friends and acquaintances, and was, in fact, quite another man.</p>

<p>“The time of his embarkation at Havre being fixed upon, he employed
the remaining six or seven weeks to see Italy; not forgetting to
buy in Milan some <em>black lace</em> for his sister, in Genoa some
<em>velvet</em> for his mother, and in Rome one or two pieces of
<em>mosaïque</em>, in order to show his taste in the fine arts. The
reason he did not purchase a <em>hat</em> at Leghorn was, that he
did not know how to dispose of it in his portmanteau. I forgot to
say, that, during all the time the young gentleman was in Europe
‘improving himself,’ he wrote home ‘the most touching letters,’
which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> shown to all the acquaintance of the family; and, it
being thought a pity that such talents should remain hidden under a
bushel, and not enlighten other Americans that did not enjoy the same
advantages, some of them actually appeared in the papers, superscribed
‘<i>Correspondence of an American Gentleman now travelling in
Europe</i>.’ What was particularly remarkable in his correspondence was
the great number of Gallicisms; showing his acquaintance with a foreign
idiom, which he had already mastered to such a degree as to forget his
own language. At last he came back from his tour, and has ever since
been a lion in our fashionable society. Such, sir, is the usual type
of our aristocrats, who are constantly railing against the levelling
system, which would confound them with the industrious mechanic, the
honest farmer, and the enterprising and thriving backwoodsman. But we
have already lost too much time with a <em>puppy</em>; I must now show
you some of our <em>men</em>.</p>

<p>“That gentleman there, whose animated conversation has brought together
a circle of hearers, is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Rives, senator from Virginia. He is one
of the best specimens of our Southern gentlemen, uniting great vigour
of mind, and the eye of a statesman, with those agreeable and affable
manners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> which throw off restraint without diminishing respect; a
gift which nature seldom bestows on those born under more Northern
latitudes. He will be a prominent candidate for the Vice-presidency,
and a great support to the democratic party. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Rives is an agreeable
speaker, clear and precise in his arguments, and an enemy to the
rhetorical or flowery style. He has no notion of sinking the bathos, or
of shaking the Senate with the thunder of his voice.</p>

<p>“Next to him stands a gentleman with a red wig and a laughing
countenance; his eyes sparkle, though he has not yet had any champaign,
and the spirits confined within his brain seem to celebrate one
continual Lord Mayor’s day. This is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Preston, senator from South
Carolina. What a pity it is he is on the side of the opposition! He is
full of fun; mixes up repartee, sarcasm, irony, and <i>persiflage</i>
in one continual strain of humorous eloquence; and is, in fact, the
prince of wags in Congress. His manners, of course, are those of a
gentleman,—which indeed he cannot help, being a South-Carolinian; and
his wit, though it sometimes touches to the quick, is accompanied by
so much good-nature that it is impossible to be angry with him. These
qualities, of course, do not make him a <em>leader</em>, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span> rather the
cavalry of the opposition; and his spirited attacks sometimes make
greater havoc than the artillery of Clay or Webster.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster you know already. He sits at yon table, playing at whist.
This is trifling away his time, for he is the last man to spend his
hours in innocent amusements. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster is, according to <em>my</em>
opinion, a gentleman without imagination or extensive reading; but of
immense natural talents, and severe application to his profession. He
is considered one of the best, and there are those who consider him
<em>the</em> best, constitutional lawyer; and, certes, his judgment,
discrimination, and logic are not surpassed by any member or senator in
Congress. Yet, with all these qualities, he is better calculated for a
debater than for a leader; his mind being more of that analytic order
which succeeds in dissecting and destroying, than of that synthetic
character which combines simple elements to an harmonious whole. The
latter requires a creative genius, and a certain intuitive knowledge
of things; whereas the process of dissection presupposes but a careful
examination of facts, and the application of sound logic.</p>

<p>“To understand where <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster’s talents lie, it is only necessary to
study his parliamentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span> tactics, and to read his speeches. He never
rises from his seat, except to repel an attack, or to take advantage of
an overture given by one of his enemies. When an important question—of
which he is hardly ever the originator—is proposed, his practice is
to wait until every one has given his opinion; he then compares them,
dissects them, analyses them, and (wonderful!) pronounces upon them
like a judge after hearing the argument of each counsel. Every flaw in
the reasoning, in the expression,—every logical imperfection is sure
to be detected; and his speech, which in truth is a critical abstract
of all the speeches delivered in Congress, passes then, with his
friends at least, for an <em>original</em> production. But I would ask,
what particular measure has he originated that produced either good
or evil to the country? The tariff?—That was <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun’s measure.
Internal improvements, or a bank.?—That honour (!) belongs to Henry
Clay. When, at the session of Congress in 1832-3, the country was
threatened with civil war, was it <em>he</em> that averted the calamity
by the proposition of a measure calculated to satisfy all parties?—No;
this honour belongs again to Henry Clay. What, then, I ask, has he done
that is so wonderful?—He is a great constitutional lawyer! That may
be; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> has not yet delivered his ideas in a scientific form, and
the commentaries of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Justice Story will perhaps outlive the fame of
Daniel Webster.</p>

<p class="center caption">DANIEL WEBSTER.<br></p>

<p class="p2">“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster’s great tact in repelling an enemy consists in personal
satire and irony. Thus he succeeded against <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Haines, and against
a number of minor opponents, who all went to swell his renown. His
speeches are clear and argumentative; but, while they occupy your
understanding, they leave you cold and cheerless. He cannot excite your
imagination; he cannot touch your feelings; and he does not stimulate
your enthusiasm. Neither is he capable of supplying this deficiency
by his personality; for, though respected and admired throughout the
country, he is not beloved,—no, not even by his own partisans. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Webster knows the laws of his country; but he is less acquainted with
the men that are to be governed by them, and possesses none of those
conciliating and engaging qualities which insure personal popularity.
This accounts for his position in Congress, where, notwithstanding
the powerful aid he lends to the opposition, he stands alone—<em>the
terrible senator from Massachusetts</em>.</p>

<p>“Neither is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster as a speaker entirely without faults. He
sometimes tries to sink the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span> bathos by being flowery and rhetorical;
and he seems to labour under the singular impression that a public
speaker must commence and leave off with a flourish, and on this
account violates his imagination with the composition of regular
beginnings and ends, which are but too frequently wholly irrelevant to
the text of his discourses. He had, in this respect, better follow the
example of certain landscape painters, who, being perfectly equal to
the <em>inanimate</em>, leave the <em>figures</em> to be done by somebody
else.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>N.B.</i>—It is now three years since I noted down the conversation
of the democratic senator. I have since heard so much of Daniel
Webster,—European writers, and especially Miss Martineau,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> having
actually made his apotheosis,—that, as a <em>pendant</em> to the Old
Bailey speech recorded in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span> last work on America, I cannot refrain
here from laying before the British reader some elegant extracts from
one of his speeches (called the <em>Great</em> Speech), in reply to the
remarks of John C. Calhoun, delivered in the Senate on the 12th of
March 1838. This speech, one of the most elaborate of which he was ever
delivered, fills, in the “New York American,” seventeen and a quarter
columns, and was intended to demolish his antagonist. It is on that
account full of personal attacks, occasionally interspersed with a
modest praise of himself.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun had been defending an independent Treasury, such as exists,
and has always existed, in every country, whether the Government was
monarchical or republican; while <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster, the advocate of a union
between the Government and the Bank, tried to ridicule the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> idea;
endeavouring to show that his adversary had been <em>previously</em>
wrong on a question relating to the <em>tariff</em>. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun, in his
opening remarks, pointed to the evils of the irresponsible American
banking system; to its “self-sustaining principle, which poised and
impelled the system, self-balanced in the midst of the heavens like
some celestial body, with scarcely a perceptible deviation from its
path from the concussion it had received;” and at last took the
following philosophic ground:—</p>

<p>“But its most fatal effects (the effects of the American banking
system) originate in its bearing on the moral and intellectual
developement of the community. The great principles of demand and
supply govern the moral and intellectual world no less than the
business and commercial. If a community be so organised as to cause a
demand for high mental attainments, they are sure to be developed. If
its honours and rewards are allotted to pursuits that require their
developement by creating a demand for intelligence, knowledge, wisdom,
justice, firmness, courage, patriotism, and the like, they are sure
to be produced. But if allotted to pursuits that require inferior
qualities, the higher are sure to decay and perish. I object to the
banking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> system, because it allots the honours and rewards of the
community in a very undue proportion to a pursuit the least of all
others favourable to the developement of the higher mental qualities,
intellectual or moral,—to the decay of the learned professions,
and the more noble pursuits of science, literature, philosophy, and
statesmanship, and the great and more useful pursuits of business and
industry. With the vast increase of its profits and influence it is
gradually concentrating in itself most of the prizes of life,—wealth,
honour, and influence,—to the great disparagement and degradation of
all the liberal, useful, and generous pursuits of society. The rising
generation cannot but feel its deadening influence. The youth who crowd
our colleges, and behold the road to honour and distinction terminating
in a banking-house, will feel the spirit of emulation decay within
them, and will no longer be pressed forward by generous ardour to mount
up the rugged steep of science as the road to honour and distinction,
when, perhaps, the highest point they could attain in what was once the
most honourable and influential of learned professions would be the
place of attorney to a bank.”</p>

<p>The force and truth of these remarks are amply illustrated by the
actual composition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> American society, and would be equally felt in
England, if, with a system of banking similar to that now in use in the
United States, the people were at any time to be <em>deprived</em> (I
use that word on purpose) of the influence of the nobility and clergy.
It is the absence of high dignitaries, and of men placed by their
birth and education above the level of ordinary men, which renders the
presence of a moneyed aristocracy in the United States truly odious
and degrading; and forces every man of sound sense, who is capable of
understanding the true position of the country by comparing it to that
of others, naturally over to the democratic party. In proportion as
science and literature will be cultivated in America, democracy will
become more and more powerful; for it is only vulgar and inferior minds
Whiggism can purchase with money.</p>

<p>To the short and pithy speech of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun, then, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster made,
as I said before, a seventeen and a quarter column answer. This I
surely have no intention of inflicting upon the innocent reader;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
but, in order to verify the criticism of the democratic senator, I
shall quote a few of those passages in which <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> gives into
the poetical,—that is, those passages in which his imagination seems
to be sufficiently excited to <em>quote</em> poetry, exhibiting his taste
in the selection,—and the grand <em>finale</em>, which will demonstrate
his art of sinking the bathos.</p>

<p>At the head of the ninth column, after expatiating at some length <em>on
the inconvenience</em> of counting money, which would ensue in case of a
Treasury, he says,</p>

<p>“But this is not all: once a quarter the naval officer is to count the
collector’s money, and the register in the land-office is to count
the receiver’s money. And, moreover, sir! every now and then the
secretary of the Treasury is to authorize unexpected and impromptu
countings in his discretion, and just to satisfy his own mind. What a
money-counting, tinkling, jingling, generation we shall be! All the
money-changers in Solomon’s temple will be as nothing to us. Our sound
<em>will go forth into all lands</em>. <em>We</em> shall be like the king
in the ditty of the nursery,</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘There sat the king a-counting of his money.’”</span><br>
</p>

<p>What mighty reasons these for not having a Treasury! And what glorious
quotation of poetry! What a beautiful association of ideas! To think
of the nursery ditty in the Senate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> the United States! How well <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Webster remembers the days of his innocence! and what a talent he must
have had, even as a boy, for finance, to remember just the verse which
relates to the “king <em>a</em>-counting of his money!”</p>

<p>The next quotation of poetry occurs on the fourteenth column, where <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Webster speaks of the issue of Treasury notes, which, as the orator
assures us, might be given out by the Government so as to <em>flood the
country</em>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>“And now I pray you to consider, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> President,” says <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster,
“what an admirable contrivance this would be to secure that economy
in the expenses of Government which the gentleman has so much at
heart. Relaxed from all necessity of taxation, and from the consequent
responsibility to the people,—(this is a wilful misrepresentation
of the fact,)—not called upon to regard at all the amount of annual
income,—having an authority to cause Treasury notes to be issued,
whenever it pleases,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘In multitudes, like which the <i>populous</i> North</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Poured</i> never from her <i>frozen</i> loins to pass</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Rhine or the Danau,’—</span><br>
</p>

<p class="p0">what admirable restraint would be on Government!” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now mark how well those three lines of blank verse are brought in!
What a beautiful simile, to compare the issue of Treasury notes to
the <em>populous</em> North <em>pouring</em> from her <em>frozen</em> loins
hordes of barbarians to cross the Rhine or the <i>Danau</i>! How
applicable! Just the thing for America! What a terrible sensation those
children of the North would make among the Yankees, just as they are
crossing the Rhine or the Danube!</p>

<p>But the conclusion of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster’s speech is a perfect <i lang="fr">chef
d’œuvre</i>. He there apostrophises Calhoun in the following manner:—</p>

<p>“Let him go! I remain! I remain where I ever have been, and ever mean
to be. Here, standing on the platform of the General Constitution,—a
platform broad enough and firm enough to uphold every interest of the
<em>whole</em> country,—I shall still be found!”</p>

<p>The words, “Let him go! I remain!” produce a sort of dramatic effect;
and are, I believe, a happy imitation of those ancient soliloquies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
which commence thus: “<em>He is gone, and I am alone.</em>” And then how
natural that the platform of the General Constitution, which is broad
enough “to uphold <em>every</em> interest of the <em>whole</em> country,”
should also support <em>him</em>! Nothing could be more <i lang="la">à propos</i>.</p>

<p>“Intrusted,” continues <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster, “with some part in the
administration of that constitution, I intend to act in its spirit, and
in the spirit of those who framed it. Yes, sir; I would act as if our
fathers who formed it for us, and who bequeathed it to us, were looking
on us,—as if I would see their venerable forms bending down to behold
us from the abodes above! I would act too, sir, as if that long line of
posterity were also viewing us, whose eye is hereafter to scrutinise
our conduct.”</p>

<p>What a thorough view and review that is! and what can be more pathetic
than to see the fathers of the constitution first <em>looking</em> upon
them, and then bending down their venerable forms to <em>behold</em> them!</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster continues the same beautiful figure still farther.</p>

<p>“Standing thus as in the full gaze of our <em>ancestors</em> and our
<em>posterity</em>, having received this inheritance from the former to
be transmitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span> the latter, and feeling that, if I am born for any
good in my day and generation, it is for the good of the whole country,
(what a modest way this of recommending himself to the Presidency!) no
local policy or local feelings, no temporary impulse shall induce me
to yield my <em>foothold</em> (!) on the constitution and the Union. I
move off under no banner not known to the whole American people, and to
their constitution and laws. No, sir; these walls, these columns,</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">——‘fly</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From their firm base as soon as I.’”</span><br>
</p>

<p>This is the third and last quotation of poetry, and a direct challenge
of the nullifier, <em>defeated by General Jackson</em>. The selection is
beautiful! <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster’s bravery needs no comment!</p>

<p>Then comes the real <em>last end</em> of the speech,—a perfect
<i>bijou</i> of rhetorical amplification.</p>

<p>“I came into public life, sir, <em>in the service</em> of the United
States.” (<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster probably means to <em>serve</em> the United
States.) “On that broad <em>altar</em> my earliest and all my public
vows have been made. I propose to serve no other <em>master</em>. So far
as depends on any agency of mine, they shall continue United States,
united in interest and affection, united in every thing in regard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
which the constitution has decreed their union; united in war, for the
common defence, the common <em>renown</em>, and the common glory; and
<em>united</em>, <em>compacted</em>, <em>knit firmly together</em> in peace,
for the common prosperity and happiness of ourselves and our children.”</p>

<p>Who does not here remember the wholesome piece of advice Napoleon gave
to his brother Lucien when the latter had sent him a proclamation
intended for the public? “I have read the proclamation,” observed
Napoleon; “it is good for nothing. There are too many words and too few
ideas in it. You struggle after pathos. This is not the way to speak to
the people. They possess more tact and judgment than you are aware of.
Your <em>prose</em> will do more harm than good.”</p>

<p>I am not disposed to undervalue <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Webster’s talent as a judge and
critic,—except as regards poetry and the arts. The bench is the proper
place for him; but as a statesman, or party leader, he can only succeed
by the blunders of his antagonists.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next gentleman to whom my democratic friend directed my attention
was a short stout figure, with a bald head, and a cold, displeasing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
repulsive countenance, which, notwithstanding, beamed with an almost
supernatural intelligence. “This is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> John Quincy Adams,” observed my
friend, “formerly President of the United States, and now a member of
Congress. Next to General Jackson, he is perhaps the most remarkable
man in the country, though he is his perfect antipode. If anything
shows the superiority of character over abstract knowledge, it is the
triumph of the honest, straightforward soldier over this hair-splitter.
Were there yet twenty Jacksons in the country, they would yet twenty
times succeed against such a man. This is a law of nature.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Adams, if you consider his acquirements, is probably the best
informed man in America, though his knowledge is somewhat rhapsodical,
like his character. He has the most astonishing memory, and possesses
great conversational powers. Yet, with all these eminent qualities,
he has not one true friend! With almost universal talent, and, I
might add, universal application, he possesses no genius, no great
personality, like Jackson, born to wield the destinies of a country.
He is full of information, understands most perfectly the routine
of business, reads everything, examines everything, and remembers
everything; and yet, when he comes to act, is sure of committing some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
blunder which will expose him and his friends. He is, in fact, a living
illustration of Voltaire’s motto:</p>

<p class="poetry" lang="fr">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘<i>Nous tromper dans nos entreprises,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>C’est à quoi nous sommes sujets;</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Le matin je fais des projets,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Et le long du jour des sottises.</i>’</span><br>
</p>

<p>The reason is, he knows Europe better than he does America;—he
is a stranger in his own country. He fights his battles on paper;
calculating the number of men, their position, and the kind of arms,
but making no allowance for their moral character. Many of his plans
are well conceived, but all are badly executed; and he has the weakness
of most bad generals, to account for his lost battles by the faults of
his inferior officers.</p>

<p>“The <i>gaucheries</i> which distinguish his political life also
mark his private intercourse; he talks better than any man in the
United States, and yet is sure to be embarrassed when addressed,
unless previously prepared for it. This want of social talent I have
frequently noticed among the most eminent men of New England, and it
accounts for their little popularity. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Adams belongs, of course, to
the opposition; but, like the independent Yankee militia-man, fights
his battles ‘<em>on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span> his own book</em>.’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He will not suffer any one
near him, and attacks indiscriminately friend or foe that opposes his
progress. Of late, few of his own party have dared to come within his
reach; for, though his political principles are somewhat <i>rococo</i>,
his wit and sarcasm are as unimpaired as ever, and his capacity to
scratch those who tread upon his toe as good as in the best days of his
manhood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Adams’s peculiar manners have, with the exception of too much
panegyric, been well described in an article entitled “Glances at
Congress,” inserted in the first number of the United States’ Magazine
and Democratic Review, published at Washington. “Our attention,” says
the reporter who furnished the article, “is now attracted to a ray of
light that glitters on the apex of a bald and noble head, ‘located’ on
the left of the House, in the neighbourhood of the Speaker’s chair.
It proceeds from that wonderful man, who in his person combines the
agitator, philosopher, poet, statesman, critic, and orator,—John
Quincy Adams. Who that has seen him sitting beneath the cupola of
the hall, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span> rays of light gathering and glancing about his
singularly polished head, but has likened him to one of the luminaries
of the age, shining and glittering in the political firmament of the
Union. There he sits hour after hour, day after day, with untiring
patience; never absent from his seat, never voting for an adjournment,
vigilant as the most jealous member of the House; his ear always on
the alert, himself always prepared to go at once into the profoundest
question of state, to the minutest point of order. What must be his
thoughts as he ponders on the past, in which he has played a part so
conspicuous! We look at him, and mark his cold and tearful eye, his
stern and abstracted gaze, and conjure up phantoms of other scenes. We
see him amid his festive and splendid halls ten years back, standing
stiff and awkward, and shaking a tall, military-looking man by the
hand, in whose honour the gala was given, to commemorate the most
splendid of America’s victories. We see him again, years afterwards,
the bitter foe of that same military chieftain, and the competitor
with him for the highest gift of a free people. We look upon a more
than king (!?), who has filled every department of honour in his
native land, still at his post; he who was the President of millions,
now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> the representative of forty odd thousand, quarrelling about
trifles or advocating high principles. To-day growling and sneering
at the House, with an abolition petition in his trembling hand; and
anon lording it over the passions, and lashing the members into the
wildest state of enthusiasm by his indignant and emphatic eloquence.
Alone, unspoken to, unconsulted, never consulting with others, he sits
apart, wrapped in his reveries; and, with his finger resting on his
nose, he permits his mind to move like a gigantic pendulum, stirring
up the hours of the past and disturbing those of the hidden future.
Or probably he is writing,—his almost perpetual employment;—but
what?—who can guess?—perhaps some poetry in a young girl’s album! He
looks enfeebled, but yet he is never tired; worn out, but ever ready
for combat; melancholy, but let a witty thing fall from any member,
and that old man’s face is wreathed in smiles. He appears passive, but
woe to the unfortunate member that hazards an arrow at him; the eagle
is not swifter in his flight than <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Adams; with his agitated finger
quivering in sarcastic gesticulation, he seizes upon his foe; and, amid
the amusement of the House, rarely fails to take a signal vengeance.</p>

<p>“His mode of speaking is peculiar. He rises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> abruptly, his face
reddens, and, in a moment throwing himself into the attitude of a
veteran gladiator, he prepares for the attack. Then he becomes full
of gesticulation, his body sways to and fro, self-command seems lost;
his head is bent forward in his earnestness till it sometimes nearly
touches the desk; his voice frequently breaks, but he pursues his
object throughout its bearings. Nothing daunts him; the House may ring
with the cries of ‘Order, order!’—unmoved, contemptuous, he stands
amid the tempest, and, like an oak that knows his gnarled and knotted
strength, stretches his arms forth, and defies the blast.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Leaning against the wall, his hands folded on his back, a contemplative
spectator of the busy scene before him, stood a gentleman with
venerable white hair, and a pale placid countenance, which at once
bespoke reserve and affability, firmness of purpose and urbanity, in
an extraordinary degree. This, as my friend acquainted me, was <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
Forsyth, formerly senator from Georgia, but now Secretary of State. He
was one of the most strenuous defenders of General Jackson’s policy at
a time when the latter had a large majority against him in the Senate,
and was shortly after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span> called into the cabinet. There he distinguished
himself by his tact, moderation, and sound statesmanlike policy. The
part he took in the recent difficulties with France is known, though it
is believed he principally acted under General Jackson’s direction.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Forsyth is one of those few members of the cabinet who have escaped
the ferocious attacks of the opposition. Though a strong partisan of
democracy, neither his private nor his public life furnished a text
for the abuses of party. Some ignorant and uncultivated persons have
<em>accused</em> (!) him of too great a devotion to the ladies; but
this reproach, so far from injuring him in the estimation of sensible
persons, only goes to elevate his character as a man.</p>

<p>It is high time for the Americans to leave off the barbarous and
ridiculous notion that a man, in order to be a statesman, a lawyer, an
orator, or a man of business, must necessarily be a bore in society. I
was once present when an American, who was in the habit of delivering
gratuitous lectures on morality, was asked by a Frenchman what sort
of impression the sight of a beautiful and lovely woman made upon
him? “Precisely the same as that of a fine <em>horse</em>,” replied
he, by way of showing the utter subjection in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> kept his
passions.—“<i>Dieu merci!</i>” cried the Frenchman; “I vill not invite
you to see my darters.” Nothing, certainly, marks the irredeemable
vulgarity of a person more strongly than his indifference to beauty and
accomplishment.</p>

<p>“There are yet three gentlemen,” continued my friend, “whom I would
gladly show you, as amongst those who have the greatest influence on
the destinies of our country; but unfortunately they are not here,
and, with the exception of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren, who is one of them, are
seldom seen at parties. To-morrow, however, after our call on General
Jackson, I shall introduce you to them personally. At present you must
excuse me; I have to see some of my colleagues in order to prepare
them for a question which I know will to-morrow come up in the Senate.
The opposition want to steal a march upon us; but I am determined they
shall find us prepared.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the senator disappeared, and with him a number of his
colleagues. Scarcely one member remained after twelve, though the
dance continued till half-past two. On this occasion I saw the first
<i>mazurka</i> danced in the United States; four fashionable ladies
consenting to be partners to three Russian gentlemen and a Polish
count, who was something of a lion in Washington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span> The three Russians
were none other than the amiable and witty Baron K—r, the Russian
minister; the clever and kind-hearted <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> K—r, the secretary of
legation; and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> G—, the <i>attaché</i>. The partners could not have
been better selected: and, though I could observe not a few sneers
in the countenances of the elderly portion of the fair, the younger
was evidently delighted; and, as I understood afterwards, practised
the steps and the “turn-abouts” more than a week, to the exclusion of
everything else. I remained until two; at which time I took another
glass of apple-toddy, which enabled me to return home without stopping
on the way at the “Epicure House.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Miss Martineau, I understood of my American friends,

the abstract; only that in her private intercourse she preferred the

the generous and brilliant hospitality of the noble Lords Lansdowne,
Holland, Sefton,—and the clever writer might have added his Grace
the Duke of Devonshire,—“a magic power, which, in the intoxication
of the moment, throws many an author off his guard, until he finds or
thinks himself irrecoverably committed, and, suppressing any lurking
inclination towards Toryism, becomes deeply and definitely a Whig.”
The administration party in America are unfortunately not much in
the habit of entertaining people; but if the number of dishes—no
matter how cooked—constituting an American dinner can be put into
the scale against the rank, beauty, wit, eloquence, accomplishment,
and agreeableness which congregate at the noble houses just named, an

<i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act iv. Scene 4.<br>
</p>


<p>The next day, at precisely ten o’clock, my friend called on me in a
carriage; and, twenty minutes later, we arrived at the White-house. On
the way thither he told me an anecdote of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson, “the father
of American democracy,” which I have since heard corroborated in a
high quarter, and which I thought sufficiently amusing to write in my
note-book.</p>

<p>Shortly after the commencement of the French revolution, when the
general war threatened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span> involve America as one of the belligerent
parties, the noble Lord E—ne, then the Honourable <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> E—ne, was sent
out as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of his British
Majesty, in order probably to maintain the friendly relations existing
between the cabinets of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> James’s and Washington. The noble lord
was then a young man, full of ardour and ambition, and devoted to the
service of his country. He was, therefore, particularly anxious to make
the best possible impression on <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson, whose party was then in
the ascendant; and accordingly determined on a splendid <i lang="fr">début</i> of
his diplomatic functions. A rich court uniform, beautifully embroidered
with gold, was selected for the purpose, together with a most costly
carriage of state; and the servants of the ambassador shone in the
richest and gayest livery ever beheld by Democrat or Tory in the
Western world.</p>

<p>In this carriage, early on a fine morning, sat the envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary, dressed in his rich court uniform, with
his credentials in his hand, conning over his harangue on his drive to
the American President. Having but a short distance to go, the carriage
stopped at the White-house just as he had finished the rehearsal; and,
immediately after, one of his footmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span> jumped off, and made the usual
English <i>tapage</i> at the door, which, being a novelty in America,
did not fail to produce alarm and confusion among the inmates. Instead
of one negro servant, two rushed forthwith to the door; but, dreading a
popular tumult, did not dare open it, until a second rap, more dreadful
than the first, proved the urgency of the case, and the necessity
of performing their duty. One of them at last summoned courage,
and, thrusting out his head without exposing his body, accosted the
ambassador’s footman in these terms:—</p>

<p>“Hallo! wat row are dat?”</p>

<p>The footman then explained that the Honourable <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> E—ne, envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of his British Majesty,
wished to wait upon his Excellency the President of the United
States. This explanation made <i>Bacchus</i> so far recover from his
fright as to induce him to open the door and admit the ambassador.
<i>Jupiter</i>, the second servant, drew also near; and, gazing upon
the rich uniform of the stranger,</p>

<p>“Bacchus,” said he, “wat are dat man so dun up for?”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the ambassador time to recover from his astonishment
when he was ushered into a small room, containing the President’s
library;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> the negroes going before him. There he waited some time,
amusing himself with looking out of the window; one of the black imps
having assured him that he would call “massa” immediately. At last
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson made his appearance, in his <i lang="fr">robe de chambre</i> and
slippers without heels. The Honourable <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> E—ne was more perplexed
than ever; but still trusting to his speech, and throwing himself into
the most graceful attitude, he commenced.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> President!”</p>

<p>“Sit down, sir!” said <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson, pointing to a seat.</p>

<p>The ambassador continued unmoved.</p>

<p>“Sit down, sir! I pray you,” reiterated <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson, throwing himself
into a large black leathern arm-chair; and the ambassador had to follow
his example.</p>

<p>The effect of the harangue being thus wholly destroyed, the British
envoy made the best of his hands and lungs. Vain effort! <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Jefferson
remained impassible; crossing his legs, and from time to time throwing
up his slipper, which with wonderful dexterity he always caught again
at the point of his toe. At last, when the ambassador came to the
end of his speech, in which he expressed the wish that the friendly
relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> which had heretofore existed between his Majesty’s Cabinet
and the Government of the United States might continue without
interruption, up goes the slipper nearly to the ceiling of the room,
and down again on the President’s toe, without the latter contracting a
muscle.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said my friend, as we were alighting from the carriage,
“we shall not be received in this manner by General Jackson, who
possesses, without exception, the most dignified manners of any man
in the country.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He is a soldier, free from artifice and disguise;
one of nature’s noblemen, possessing more genuine politeness than
nine-tenths of our fashionable people, who import their good-breeding
from Europe. He is, in fact, a phenomenon in our country, which the
present money-making generation cannot understand,—a living paradox in
the eyes of our capitalists; aiming at the happiness of the people by
destroying the National Bank,—a monster ‘who would rather see commerce
and credit perish than the constitution of the country!’”</p>

<p>“Is General Jackson at home?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span> senator of the Irish servant
that opened the door.</p>

<p>“He is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Here is my card,” said I, “if you wish to announce me.”</p>

<p>“That is not necessary,” replied my friend; “every one can see the
President.”</p>

<p>We walked up one pair of stairs, and, the General happening to be
alone, were immediately admitted into his presence. On our entering
the room, the General rose, and shook us both by the hand. He then
asked us to sit down, and in a few minutes I felt more at my ease than
I ever did in the house of an American broker. Understanding that I
was a German, he told us, that while in North Carolina, not far from a
number of “Dutch” settlements, he applied himself assiduously to the
study of the German language; but, “moving” soon afterwards to the
State of Tennessee, was obliged to give it up. “It is a fine language,”
added he, “spoken by an honest people.” He then drew a picture of the
German settlements, and of the Germans in general, which betrayed a
knowledge of character I have not yet had the good fortune to discover
in any of his political antagonists. From the Germans the conversation
turned to the Irish, whose leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span> features he traced with the same
accuracy; and so he went on discussing every set of emigrants, and at
last the people of his own country. The sketch he gave of the last was
excellent, and proved him to be thoroughly <em>master of his subject</em>.</p>

<p>After this, the senator, in order to draw him out, introduced various
political topics, on which the General expressed himself without a
moment’s hesitation with the utmost determination and precision. It
was as if every thought and principle he uttered had been fixed in his
mind ever since he was born, and had never undergone a change up to the
present period. Politics with him do not consist in a mere series of
cold rules and maxims, in order to obtain a particular object; he is an
enthusiast, full of faith in the people and in the perfectibility of
human nature, and deeply imbued with the purest religious sentiments.
No abstract argument can drive him from his position, for he is nothing
separate. He is a politician, a soldier, an enthusiast for the rights
of the people, and a Christian at the same time. If the politician is
convinced, there remain still the soldier, the enthusiast, and the
Christian to be satisfied; if the soldier is captured, there remains
still the enthusiast; and so on. He is always a whole; head, heart,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span> hand,—conception, determination, and action—being one and
inseparable. Such men are always a riddle to the world, accustomed as
the vulgar are to ascribe every signal success to a particular talent,
or to this or that capacity, without ever considering the connection
between mind and character.</p>

<p>Of General Jackson’s enthusiasm I soon had an opportunity of satisfying
myself. Miss Martineau being at that time in Washington, and having
been overheard to make a remark at her boarding-house to this effect,
“that it was really a wonder General Jackson succeeded against the
United States’ bank, considering that all the talent and the genius
of the country were against him,” my friend seized the opportunity to
direct the General’s attention to the peculiar manner in which British
writers were accustomed to view his government. Upon this he rose from
his chair, drew himself up to his full height, and, with his eyes
flashing fire, remarked to the senator:—“You might have told her, sir,
that all the <em>honesty</em> and <em>integrity</em> of the country were on
<em>my</em> side.” Then, without uttering another syllable, he resumed
his seat, and was as friendly and agreeable as before.</p>

<p>Shortly after, an old man of the “far West”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span> entered the room. Jackson
rose to salute him, but was told, almost in a sulky manner, “not to
disturb himself, it being evident that he was engaged;” and that the
stranger, who wore boots, and a cloak with three capes, “would amuse
himself, in the mean while, with looking on the pictures.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said the General; but following him with his eyes, and
perceiving him standing still before an engraving representing a battle
fought in the revolutionary war, the thought seemed to strike him that
the man, who was very old, might have been a revolutionary soldier.</p>

<p>“You are perhaps acquainted with the details of that battle?” said
General Jackson, drawing near him.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am, sir,” said the veteran; “I was myself engaged in it, and
carried off a nice keep-sake here on my left arm.”</p>

<p>I do not remember what dialogue now ensued between the soldier and the
General,—it was, indeed, too rapid for me to follow it; but I saw the
old man, who at first answered the General sulkily, grow warmer and
warmer, until at last he was actually moved to tears. He sternly gazed
on the President’s face; then, as if a sudden revolution had taken
place in his mind, he turned round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span> wished the General a good morning,
and left the room. This man may have been an enemy to General Jackson’s
administration, who had come to see the President for no other purpose
but to satisfy his curiosity; but I am quite sure he left him with the
determination to vote for him at the next election.</p>

<p>Our visit was soon again interrupted by the arrival of three gentlemen
from the Northern States. They came to Washington to pay their
respects to the President, who almost instantaneously recognised
them as belonging to the opposition. His expressions and manners
were remarkably guarded; and, in a short time, he introduced the
subject of manufactures. He inquired particularly into the method of
cotton-spinning, and at least managed to keep them in good-humour. Soon
after we all left together, and, in going down stairs, I heard one of
the company say, “He would not be so bad a President after all, if he
were not so d—d obstinate!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the senator, as we were again seated in our carriage,
“how do you like the President?”</p>

<p>“He is, indeed, an extraordinary man!”</p>

<p>“And have you observed his talent in making himself beloved by all who
come near him? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span> have probably seen him with his enemies; but you
ought to see him when he is without restraint among his friends,—how,
from pure benevolence, he just says to every man what is most agreeable
to him!—how delicately he alludes to every little service rendered
him!—how he remembers every act of kindness, every opinion expressed
in favour of his measures,—and you would at once perceive the reason
of his unparalleled popularity.</p>

<p>“And then see him again in his cabinet,—explaining his political
principles, and providing for the means of carrying them into
effect,—always determined, never wavering on account of the doubts
raised by his friends, and inspiring his own council with confidence
in his measures,—and you would be convinced that General Jackson, so
far from being influenced by his advisers, is himself the director of
his cabinet, in which, perhaps, he rules with as much absolute power as
any potentate in Europe. And yet, with all this <i>penchant</i> towards
absolutism, what a staunch defender of democracy! the Wellington of
our Liberals! and who knows but that Wellington, had he been born in
America, would not have acted like Jackson; finding the democratic form
of government the most legitimate, the most natural, and that which is
sure to develope all the resources of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span> country? Minds of the same
tenor sometimes act very differently under different circumstances; and
<em>he who in England is a strong Conservative, may in America, for very
analogous reasons, be a sound Democrat</em>.</p>

<p>It was not long after my presentation at General Jackson’s that I
had the honour of taking tea with him; which gave me an opportunity
of seeing him in his private circle. The invitation was given
unceremoniously, just at the moment I was going to take leave of him.
We passed into another room, where the company, consisting of his
private secretary, his adopted son and his lady, and a gentleman who
has since had an important influence on public affairs, were assembled
round a small table,—Mrs. Jackson (the wife of his adopted son)
doing the honours of the house. After each of us had taken the place
assigned him by the lady, General Jackson rose, and with a loud and
solemn voice, which bore the imprint of sincerity, thanked the Giver of
all for His infinite mercy. The prayer was short, but impressive; and
the example of his devotion had a visible effect on every individual
present. Add to this, that General Jackson is a tall majestic-looking
man, with a stern countenance, grey piercing eyes, and bushy white
hair, that stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span> almost perpendicularly on his head, leaving his
large high forehead entirely free, and you will easily conceive the
solemnity of the thanks’-offering of the American President.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic anecdotes of General Jackson relates to
the late difficulties between the Governments of the United States and
France, when the King of the French seemed to insist on an apology from
the President. This, as is well known, General Jackson peremptorily
refused; and accordingly a cabinet council was convened in Washington,
in which every member delivered his opinion according to his own
manner, General Jackson listening to all with the utmost patience.
There was the Secretary of State, not knowing how far a war with France
would be supported by the people of the different States; the Secretary
of the Treasury was already computing the deficit in the budget; the
Secretary of the Navy thought it his duty to observe that the naval
force of the United States was hardly capable of coping with that of
the French; and at last came the Secretary of War, who alluded to the
state of the army, a great portion of which was absorbed by the Indian
campaign. General Jackson remained immoveable. At last, when every one
had finished, he rose; and, placing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> hand with some violence on
the table, said in a solemn and firm voice: “We have obtained judgment
against the French King; and, by the Eternal! we must sue out the
execution!”—“But what if we meet with reverses? The French will cut
off our commerce; they will arm privateers against our merchantmen;
and what if they attempt a landing?”—“That’s precisely the thing
they will attempt,” observed General Jackson calmly; “and you may
depend upon it we will give them a good drubbing.” This anecdote gave
rise to a caricature, representing a French army, led by the Gallic
cock, swimming across the Atlantic; and General Jackson standing on
the American shore with his cane drawn, and a numerous staff behind
him, expecting their arrival. Another caricature, drawn after the
settlement, representing General Jackson holding in his left hand a bag
of money, with the figures 25,000,000 written on it, and in his right
hand a cane, which he is shaking at Louis Philippe, with the words
to his mouth, “’Tis well that you paid me, or, by the Eternal!” to
which the King is represented bowing, and saying, “Not another word of
apology, my dear General!” has already been mentioned in another work.</p>

<p>The following fact, which was related to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span> by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Power, an American
sculptor of much merit, now at Florence, is yet deserving a place in
my note-book. When <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Power was last in Washington to take a bust
of General Jackson, a friend observed to the artist that it would be
impossible for him to give the right expression to the mouth, the
General having lost his front teeth, which destroyed the expression
of firmness about his lips; and that he had therefore better try to
persuade the General to wear false teeth for one or two sittings. The
artist, grateful for the hint, did not omit to ask General Jackson in a
truly Western manner (<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Power was born and brought up in Cincinnati)
whether he had ever worn false teeth? “I have,” said the General; “but
I am sorry for it.”—“But had you not better put them in once more, to
give me an opportunity of modelling the mouth; it would greatly enhance
the effect.”—“The <em>truth</em>, sir! the whole truth, and nothing:
but the truth!” exclaimed the General with a stern voice; “you have no
right to represent me otherwise than I am.”</p>

<p>What simplicity of character! and yet what energy and perseverance!</p>

<p>We drove from the White-house towards Georgetown; stopping at one of
the houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span> called “The Seven Buildings.” This was the dwelling of the
Vice-President. My friend gave both our names, and in a moment after
we were admitted into the presence of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren. He received us
in the same manner as General Jackson, only with less solemnity. His
conversation was rapid, but concise and logical; his voice calm and
steady, and his manners those of a perfect courtier. Understanding that
I was a German, he introduced the subject of travelling, which gave
him an opportunity of comparing the scenery on the Rhine with that of
the Hudson, and pointing out the distinct beauties of each; which he
did with more taste and less affectation than I had yet heard from an
American when speaking of foreign countries. He gave the preference
to his native river, and supported his opinion with such forcible
arguments that he converted me to his doctrine. He then drew a parallel
between the state of Europe and that of the United States; pointing
to the advantages of the latter, to their government, the manners and
customs of the people, and to their happiness. All this he did with
so much gentleness, with such an entire absence of conceit, and such
admirable management of terms, that it was impossible either to resist
his eloquence or to be offended with his conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>Our visit was interrupted by the arrival of several Western members,
who, being alarmed at General Jackson’s message in relation to
the differences with France, desired to know whether it was the
Vice-President’s opinion that France would pay “without having a tug
for it.” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren, without being for one moment embarrassed
by this abrupt question, instead of an answer, took up a British
periodical, the name of which I do not now recollect, but which treated
the French-American question in a very sensible manner. From this
he read to the members several passages, which expressed themselves
favourably to General Jackson’s policy; and at last the conclusion,
which ran thus, “Jonathan has claimed the money, and Jonathan will have
it.” The members were delighted; and the conversation then passed to
other topics. I mention this as an instance of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren’s tact, a
quality full as indispensable to a statesman as a sound knowledge of
politics.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Well, and what do you think of our Vice-President?” asked my friend,
as we were driving towards the lodgings of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> John C. Calhoun.</p>

<p>“I have certainly left him with the highest respect for his mind and
character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“And yet, sir! there are those who call him an <em>intrigant</em>, a
‘little magician,’ a ‘non-committal man,’ &amp;c. though there is not one
man in the country whose attachment to the democratic cause is better
known or understood. The firmness of a man’s political principles is,
in this country at least, always commensurate with the degree of abuse
heaped upon him by the opposite party. Our people, I mean ‘the higher
and better informed classes,’ are seldom inexorable with regard to a
politician holding out some chances of conversion; but let a man’s
character be established, and there is no end to their vituperation.
This has happened to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren, and ought to be considered by every
democrat as a pledge of his fidelity.</p>

<p>“What act of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren has ever had any other than democratic
tendency? What principle did he ever advocate that was not strictly
conformable to that doctrine? If he be a non-committal man, it must be
that he never committed himself <em>to his enemies</em>.</p>

<p>“The reason why in America, more than in every other country,
political controversies are personal, is, that the opposition, which
in consequence of universal suffrage can only triumph by popular
majorities, is obliged to apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> uphold the principles maintained
by the democracy; so that, while it cannot make war upon the general
doctrines of the administration, it is concentrating all its venom
in its attacks on particular measures, and the men who support them.
Let any Whig, either in or out of Congress, deny the correctness
of this proposition, and, I say, he either does not understand our
institutions, or he is wilfully disguising the truth. There is no other
real distinction of parties in the United States, except, that one
really does or means to do what it says; while the other is saying one
thing, and preparing or hoping to be able to do another. There is more
political hypocrisy in this country than perhaps anywhere else,—not
among the people, but among ‘the upper classes;’ owing to the basis
of our society being purely democratic, and the superstructure a
lamentable imitation of the usages of Europe.</p>

<p>“I know,” continued he after a pause, “that no administration or set of
men is without its political misconceptions and mistakes; but have the
opposition calculated how many of these are to be charged to their own
account? Into how many errors they force the administration by their
reckless and indiscriminate resistance against all measures emanating
from the executive? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> do they not thus force the government to avail
itself continually of ‘the party’ in carrying measures which ought to
originate in calm reflection and sound statesmanship, and be applied in
a generous spirit to all classes of society? The spirit of party is,
indeed, at the basis of our institutions; an opposition we must have,
and the peculiar nature of our government requires a powerful one; but
most unfortunately our demagogues—Whigs and Democrats—oppose men,
not principles. If there be a man in the country capable of acting as
mediator between the two hostile parties,—appeasing the one without
sacrificing the principles of the other,—that man is <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren;
and future events will prove it.”</p>

<p>We now halted before a small house in Pennsylvania Avenue, situated not
far from the Capitol. This was the temporary residence of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> John C.
Calhoun, senator from South Carolina. If the South, in general, have a
right to be proud of the great number of eminent statesmen and orators
who represent its interests in Congress, South Carolina in particular
may glory in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun. He is a statesman, not a lawyer; and perhaps
the only senator in Congress whose course of reading was strictly
adapted to the high functions he was to assume. When my friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> and
I entered the room, he was stretched on a couch, from which he rose
to offer us a warm Southern welcome. He almost immediately introduced
the subject of politics, in which his superiority over my friend soon
reduced the latter to the situation of a mere listener.</p>

<p>As he was explaining his views and theories, which, contrary to the
usual American practice, he did in the most concise manner, and with a
degree of rapidity which required our utmost attention to follow him,
his face assumed an almost supernatural expression; his dark brows were
knit together, his eyes shot fire, his black hair stood on end, while
on his quivering lips there hung an almost Mephistophelean scorn at
the absurdity of the opposite doctrine. Then, at once, he became again
all calmness, gentleness, and good-nature, laughing at the blunders of
his friends and foes, and commencing a highly comical review of their
absurdities.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun is, without contradiction, the greatest genius in Congress,
and secretly acknowledged as such even by his most declared political
enemies. His speeches are the shortest, his political views the
most elevated, his delivery the most impressive of any one of his
colleagues; and he adds to all these qualities the most unsparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
irony. He was Vice-President at the commencement of General Jackson’s
administration; but subsequently joined the Whigs in order to oppose
the tariff, <em>nullified</em> by his native State. Without this step,
which destroyed his popularity in the North, he would, with very
little opposition, have become General Jackson’s successor in office.
This alone proves the absurdity of the charge of unlawful ambition
repeatedly brought against him. The Presidential chair of <em>the United
States</em>, once within his reach, was assuredly a higher mark than
the Presidency of “the <em>Southern</em> Union,” the <i lang="fr">bête noire</i>
of the enlightened opposition. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Calhoun has lately again joined the
administration in its endeavour to separate itself from the banks; a
short extract from his speech I have already presented in a previous
note.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You must yet see one of our most remarkable men,” said my friend; “but
I cannot take you to his house. You must see him at his office, where
he is from five o’clock in the morning till late at night, always ‘up
and doing.’ I mean the fifth auditor, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Amos Kendall, who, according
to the account of the opposition, has governed the country for the last
six or eight years, and against whose genius their united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span> talents
were unable to prevail. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall is a native of Massachusetts, and
a graduate of Dartmouth College. He emigrated to Kentucky, where, like
many New-Englanders, he was for a time employed as an instructor,
and for a short time engaged as private tutor in <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Clay’s family.
He subsequently became editor of a paper, which is said to have
revolutionised <em>the State</em>, and, inasmuch as the leading articles
of one journal are copied into the others, <em>the whole country</em>.”</p>

<p>“No man knows like <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall how to address the people: his language
is always popular, and yet concise; he never destroys the effect of
a strong thought by spinning it out into a long sentence; and, above
all, he avoids declamation. His style is forcible; because it convinces
the people in their own way, instead of fatiguing them with laborious
researches, or overwhelming them with the unfathomable pathos of a
regular orator. He has shown to his political opponents that the
various principles of democracy may be united into a system, and that
that system may be maintained in practice by a government strong within
and without.”</p>

<p>At this moment our coach stopped at the entrance of the war department,
and the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span> minute we were ushered into the audience-chamber of the
fifth auditor. He was at that moment talking to several people that
besieged his office, without leaving off writing. When I was introduced
to him, he made a slight motion forward, seizing me by the hand; but
immediately sank back again into his chair with a seeming intention to
recommence his labours. He spoke but a few words, principally by way
of asking questions; and having ascertained who I was, what I sought,
and what my opinions were, was evidently forming an estimate of my mind
and character. While he was thus conversing with my friend and me,
filling up the intervals with writing, I observed that he was equally
watching the rest of the company; among whom I recognised an individual
who I knew did not in his native place enjoy a very high reputation for
industry, and who, to judge from <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall’s glances at him, had no
particular chance of success in Washington.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall’s person is one of the most striking I ever beheld. He
is of a spare frame, of rather less than middle stature, and, when
walking or standing, inclines his body slightly forward. His face
is pale, wearing the imprint of over-exertion; but his large eyes
are full of animation, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> forehead, the highest and broadest I
ever saw, bespeaks the greatest intellectual power. His head, which
indeed is one of the most extraordinary phrenological specimens, is
of the most unusual size when compared to his body; and it seems as
if, by continual exertion of his intellectual faculties, his whole
body had been made tributary to his brain. A man with <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall’s
extraordinary powers of mind, and such indefatigable habits of
industry,—calm, passionless, and endowed with the most unerring
judgment,—must naturally be hated by his political antagonists; though
not even the most obstinate members of the opposition have as yet
ventured to dispute his talents.</p>

<p>We did not remain long at the office; but, on our way home, my friend
finished the picture. “You ought to see him in the centre of his
family,” said he: “what an excellent husband and father! in his private
intercourse how remarkably modest and unassuming! He has indeed but one
fault, which, however, is sufficient to damn him with our fashionable
people: he is not fond of the dissipations of society, and does not
give sumptuous entertainments.”</p>

<p><i>N. B.</i> <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall is now Postmaster-general, and as such a
member of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Van Buren’s cabinet. Though in rank the last, he is
known by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span> friend and foe to be the first in activity; and his counsel
is decisive with the most experienced men in Washington. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Kendall
commenced his political career not more than ten years ago with
editing a small paper in the Western country; and stands now foremost
in the ranks of the most eminent statesmen of America. If he were a
<i>parvenu</i> merchant or broker, he would be cited by the aristocracy
as an example worthy of imitation; but, having risen merely by his
<em>talents</em> and his <em>pen</em>, the very mention of his name is
offensive to the high-minded stock-jobbers in Wall and State streets.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In order to form a correct idea of the American government, it is
absolutely necessary one should stay some time in Washington; and
frequent, not merely the fashionable society, but the company of
those sturdy members of Congress, who, deputed from every part of the
Union, actually represent the opinions, habits, and sentiments of the
different sections of the country. During the session of Congress,
Washington is the miniature picture of the United States; enabling a
stranger to form a better estimate of the character of the American
people than many years’ residence in different parts of the Union. The
picture is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> always complete, not a mere fragment, as is necessarily the
case in any other city east or west of the Alleghanies. It is there
one can take a correct view of the state of parties; of the magnitude
of the different interests, whether commercial, manufacturing, or
agricultural; and of the political prospects of the country.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing and instructive occupations is to contrast
the representatives from the “New States” (the men that have not yet
learned how to bow, and do not yet know what <span class="allsmcap">P. P. C.</span> on a
card means,) with the supple members from New York or Massachusetts,
with their French and English civilization hanging loosely about them,
like a garment not made for their use; how the latter are striving
for ascendency, and how they are daily losing influence with those
vigorous sons of the West, that reflect the genius and enterprise of a
new world! The West—not the East continually troubled with European
visions—is ultimately destined to sway the country. The sea does not
separate America from Europe; but behind the Alleghanies is springing
up a new life, and a people more nearly allied to the soil that
nourishes them, than the more refined and polished population of the
seaboard.</p>

<p>To sum up the whole: what is termed “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span> aristocracy of America”—that
is, a considerable portion of all people worth from fifty to an
hundred thousand dollars,—are, <em>owing to the growing power of the
West</em>, a most harmless, though I cannot say “inoffensive,” part
of the population. They live in houses a little larger than those
inhabited by respectable mechanics, cover the floors of their parlours
with Brussels carpets instead of Kidderminster, pay nine pence for
beef which the labourer purchases for eight, pay a shilling more for a
pound of tea, and keep a man-servant. Some of them keep a carriage, but
by far the greater part are content with hackney-coaches. In point of
accomplishment they are only inferior to the middle classes of Europe;
but in pride and conceit they surpass the ancient nobility of the
Holy Roman Empire and the thirty-four princes of the actual Germanic
Confederation. This circumstance does not much add to their amiability,
and does not in particular grace the boys and girls composing “the
first society.” Some of them lay a great stress on family when it is
joined to money; but, without this most indispensable requisite, <i lang="fr">la
vertu sans argent n’est qu’un meuble inutile</i>. It is, however, to
be observed that property not only produces respectability, but also
acts backwards on a man’s ancestry;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> there being not one rich man in
the United States,—foreigners excepted,—who is not descended from a
respectable father and grandfather.</p>

<p>In politics they are the most implacable enemies to democracy; which,
with them, is synonymous with mob-government and anarchy. They are
for a <em>strong</em> administration, made out of their own party; and
would hardly object to royalty, if the King would support himself out
of his private chest. A court in Upper Canada, such as Lord Durham
established there for a short time, would be a great attraction, and
would undoubtedly cause many emigrations to Quebec. In all other
respects their political opinions do not seriously differ from those of
the mass of the people, except that they are for two trifling reforms
in the <i lang="la">status quo</i>,—the introduction of an electoral census, and
the re-establishment of the law of primogeniture. It is true that, had
this reform been carried ten years ago, they would themselves be in the
situation of those against whom these measures are now intended to be
effectual; but this is a matter of no consideration when compared to
the good which would accrue from it to “society.”</p>

<p>But it is not so much in America as in <i>Europe</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span> that the true
character of the American aristocracy can be successfully studied. At
home the vulgar clamour of the mob, and a few silly editors setting up
for the representatives of public opinion, interfere too much with the
display of their true sentiments. It is but in Europe—where they are
relieved from these trammels—that they show the natural man, their
<i>penchant</i> for the elegancies of society, their contempt for the
poor, and their toad-eating to the higher classes, in which they even
“beat the English.” It is there they sink the “American citizen,” in
order to become noblemen without pedigrees, and courtiers without
manners. I would therefore recommend to the next English tourist that
is going to publish a work on “American Society,” to visit the courts
of Italy and France rather than the United States. He will there find
richer materials for a satire on American institutions than he would
be able to discover from the State of Maine to Louisiana, and from the
broad Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains. I am only able thus to throw out
the hint, and leave the execution of the plan to a pen abler than my
own.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
